text I love this cd(its like a new age rock sound): this cd rocks. its been awhile since i have seen a good cd. alot of the old songs but done in a rap or hip hop likeness. Wait don't stop reading because u don't like rap or hip hop. if u like cypress hill u will love this cd and if not its a different sound of rock. listen u will make this cd bad if u think of it as an all hip hop or rap cd. think of this cd as rock when u get and when u listen to it because u will see that it sounds like alot of other rock remixes. it has a limp bizket remix sound but the people that help to make these remixes are all rock. for example Aaron lewis(staind) and Johnthan Davis(korn). if u still have doubts then think about track 20 which is Aaron lewis and linkin park singing crawling together. that is all rock and if u want my advice get this cd plus the cd i have has a kool linkin music video wit robots. add this one to the stack: if you like hybird theory you will love this. Reanimation gives a good mixture of mixes of the old stuff plus new music. Incropated in the smooth beat are rap rock lyrics. This is a must have to add to any collection" Ghetto [garbage]: Ok....Why??? I loved Hybrid Theory, but this is just [garbage]. Over half the songs are remixed in a new ""thugged-out"" style that really tosses out all the emotion and intelligence of the lyrics. I did like My[Dsmbr, Kyur4 Th Ich, and Krwlng. But most of the rest are for all the suburban Ludacris-wanna-be's in their lowered Escalade with the gold rims."" boooooooooo!: .....oh geesh!,I don't know why we're an amazed society ,why the people always get impress with poor musical pieces like this.....come on dude just give n sync or bsb a couple nor metal riffs an d fancy scratches and you have linkin park....yeah this album really atinks....and not just this album....hybrid theory neither....please grow up guys...I know this album is kinda poular but that doesn't mean is great....you like metal? listen to brujeria pendejos!"" I'M ABOUT TO BREAK!!!!!: This is a great cd. Some people will be dissapointed because it contains more rap then Hybrid Theory. On the other hand, die-hard Linkin Park fans will love it. The new mix of ""Crawling"" is beautiful. I was kinda dissapointed in ""One Step Closer"" though. It was way too slow. But overall, great listening fun. Buy it now."" almost perfect: This cd had great remixes of some songs, but others weren't as good.And some of the other songs were not good.But I still reccomend it.It is a great cd for linkin park fans."" WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK: when i heard linkin park was going to make a remix album of hybrid theory, i knew it was going to be bad. all remix albums are bad, so my friend fei xenogear (also posted here) let me borrow his copy of reanimation...and i was right, it has to be the worst album i have ever heard...i'd rather listen to my sisters copy of TLC's fan mail, i didn't think anything could be as bad as that, guess i was wrong" is this Linkin Park-?: i love LP .. this is the reason why i bought Reanimation on it's release dateBUT .. LP steps onto their hip/hop side to leave alternative fans hungry .. composed of mainly rap and throbbing beats .. there is no longer beauty in their tunes .. admist all the remix and cameos by outside artists .. LP lost their true identity which is disappointing. Quiero Decirte: All of there CDs are awesome I only like the ones where the same singer was inn since the group started. I don't really like then new singer voice. creoles: Really enjoyed this book. I loved the combination of fact and fiction and the famliy photos. It flowed well and was interesting. It's amazing how times have changed and how racist this country was and is." Yes! The Summer's Two BEST Reads!: The newspaper is right! Cane River by Lalita Tademy and Tending Roses by Lisa Wingate are the summer's two best reads! Both of these books are gripping, beautifully written, filled with emotional moments and strong characters. Cane River is a masterpiece of historical fiction, showing the intertwining of generations. The author's words flow like the river itself, and are strong and gripping like the characters in the book. If you don't read anything else this summer, read Cane River and Tending Roses. Both are books I would not have missed, ones I will keep forever, and recommend to every reader I know. I want to shout it from the mountaintops! Read these two books!"" Lousy: I was very excited to read this book. I didn't bother to continue after the first several chapters however. Its too bad really because its a great concept to spin a yarn from one's heritage but I found the verbiage forced and clearly written by an amatuer. Since I'm not a writer, I expect to read books written by people who can write better than I can. In this case, I felt like I was reading a story written by a teenager whose English teacher assigned her the task of writing a story. That's the last time I will bother with ""Oprah's"" club...that endorsement alone should have made me know better. The last book I read was by Pat Conroy and while his books might be more about ""fluff"" than this, the literary value is so superior, perhaps that was the problem. Literature is a gift...you either have it or you don't.This one didn't."" Couldn't put it down: Cane River as an absolutely fantasic work of art. Ms. Tademy has a spell-binding way of writing that draws you into each of the real-life characters of her timeless family story. This book was educational as well as entertaining. It made me cry, it made me think. The book is so engulfing in it's story, that you just don't want to put it down. It is very smoothly written; thus, an easy and quick read. I would highly recommend this book to those who are interested in genealogy, African-American history, sagas, and an edge of the seat read."" Good Book: I read CANE RIVER after my husband and I visited the Cane River Creole National Historic Park here in Louisiana. This book was a great supplement for the trip. I generally shy away from Oprah's choices, because I've only read 1 "" Cool and Clever: Impressive! It held my interest from beginning to end, and I liked that it didn't spoon-feed the viewer. The settings, angles, and lighting of shots greatly added to the suspense. The actors playing ""Billy"" and the ""Doctor"" gave very good performances. I can easily see how the film received Festival invites, nomination, and an award."" Uncle Ted: This cd rocks, but I find Free for All his best cd, but everyone who likes good ol Uncle Ted should own it. After Free for All and Great White Buffalo live version Uncle Ted losses his edge."" Ted Nugent (1975): Ted Nugent's 1975 album for Epic records has become a hard rock classic. Featuring one of Nugent's best and best known songs ""Stranglehold"", this album rocks from start to finish. This is probably Ted Nugent's best album. Highlights include: Stranglehold, Just What the Doctor Ordered, Stormtroopin, Hey Baby and Snakeskin Cowboys. A must for your hard rock collection."" A good CD with little replay value: This CD is a hilarious remake of several punk classics from bands like The Ramones, The Damned, and others. This CD is really funny the first time you hear it. When I first heard My Homeboy is a Joto, I [lost it]. The second time I heard this CD, it was a little less funny. The third time, a little less, and...well...you get the picture. Now I went and sold the thing because I can't stand it anymore. It's like owning a Weird Al album: you might like it at first, but by the end you'll hate yourself for ever spending money on it.If you really want some good punk covers with endless replay value, check out Me First and the Gimme Gimmes."" Beautiful little cups: These cups and saucers are great. The colors are lovely and it's fun to mix and match cups with saucers. They are a nice size and, wonderfully, dishwasher safe."" More, Please...: ASL is a beautiful language, gaining more mainstream recognition over the past few years. However, 'making it' in mainstream media is not the easiest thing for anyone, let alone when there is a language/culture barrier.This doc follows four very different performers in their quest to do what comes naturally to them. It's not always pretty, but it's worth watching.Personally, I would love to see more Deaf work in mainstream distribution. If the work is publicized to common outlets [more on amazon, please], it automatically is more accessible.I would have preferred that the documentarian provide full sketches from the two actors. Maybe it was her goal to keep us wanting more? If so, she was successful.More, more, more...You don't need a big distributor. Make your own dvd and go through createspace."" emi comedy laurel and hardy: listen to it in the car and it makes any journey more pleasureable.its a must for l&h fans,listen to some great clips from films as well as songs and music" works great: good product and works well. Great value and came with nice carrying case. Its a bit heavy but other than that its great." More explanation than workout: I'm ok at following directions, but the complexity of the steps and the long explanations made this not so fun and impractical for learning to learn even short sections of the workout. Disappointing." Overall good product: Exactly what I expected. Not more or less. Although i didn't care very much for the solo section in the end i get where it comes from. We did that at the end of each class with drummers playing live. But it felt rather weird on a workout video. In the end though it is a well produced program. Great for beginners but experienced dancers might not be challenged." good book: The title is misleading and could have been more accurate. The book was somewhat wordy. However, it is a good introduction to the topic of women as soldiers throughout history, especially during the American Civil War. The best writing is the last couple chapters when the authors discuss their feelings on the role of women in society and specifically as soldiers."" Boring: I read this book because it was my book club's choice. The best thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise and the worst thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise. This one falls under the second. No continuity, no story, just a compilation of research results. It might work as a thesis to fulfill a degree program but not as general reading. Boring." it sucks: Worked great for two months and then just died for no reason. Other than being used. Now it a paper weight now and every now and then. I'll try hooking it up and hope that it starts working again.;( I have a lot better mixer now. You get what you pay for. Sorry folks I got this mixer about 3 years ago. Just started writing now. They may have fixed the power problem now." NOT ANOTHER FIX THE MOTHER BOOK!!!: Very catching title, I will admit that but the book does not deliver. The book gives you tons of ways to fix yourself ( the mom) to make yourself better understand, take abuse, forgive, forget, relax, take a bath, etc. Granted when your daughter screams ""I hate you"" its fine to walk away and take a nice bath. But, when your daughter is in this century we all know things are much worse. Teenage girls are cutting themselves, doing hard drugs, having sex in middle school, running away, and much more. This book is too naive for the real world. The book is out of date and wastes your money telling the mom to not take anything personally. I don't know about you--but after 7 years of verbal abuse I just might take some of it personally." Not for continous use: There are other headsets with more flexible headband and more comfortable design at this price. I didnt notice any difference between the boom mic and a normal one considering the recording quality." Mistakes from 1815-1823: This book has mistakes. It means to describe the uniforms from the Dutch-Belgian troops during the Napoleontic Wars. In the Dutch case that is Quatre-Bras and Waterloo (1815). But the uniforms described in this book are the ones depicted in Teupkens 1823 book on Dutch uniforms. Therefore the descriptions are about 8 years too late. Between 1815 and 1823 there were over 200 changes in Dutch uniforms and the authors don't take these changes into account. There might be some correct uniforms described in the book, but I researched the engineers uniform and that is wrong."" 1815-1823 mistakes: This book has mistakes. It means to describe the uniforms during the Napoleontic Wars, i.e. in the Dutch-Belgian case Quatre-Bras and Waterloo. But in fact its uniforms are based on the ones described in a 1823 Dutch book by Teupken. Therefore the information is about 8 years too late. Between 1815 and 1823 there were over 200 uniform changes for the Dutch soldiers and officers. The book might be OK for some uniforms but keep this in mind. I have studied the engineers uniform and it WRONG in this book." The only listenable NOW Compilation: All the NOW's since this one have sucked. Music has just gradually gone downhill since this was released. Now we're lucky if there are 3 good songs on the recent NOW's. I'm sure glad I've branched out on my music interests beyond what is just played on the radio." My Arctic Flying Bible: I gotta say that Bud and Martha Helmericks were by far the single greatest influence in my flying life and career over the more than thirty years that I've been doing this stuff.Their courage and ingenuity, sense of adventure, and love of the land and people of Arctic Alaska drew me like a moth to a flame. And it was in their footsteps that I followed, using Bud's writings as a guide in my flying, and as a model in coming to understand the true depth of the people who live there.My life is so much richer because of those two wonderful people and their family, and I am truly blessed to have been able to live and fly, and come to know the lands and people of the far north. I live Lower 48 now, but a huge part of my heart remains north of the Arctic Circle. ...The world is not a better place with Bud Helmericks not in it."" Entertaining Mystery: Travis McGee does it again, with attitude. These books are loads of fun and this one is no exception. I had it sort of figured out pretty early on, but enjoyed watching the whole thing unfold. These books are so funny with their 1960s male perspective, and I love the little details that MacDonald includes. Suspenseful, funny and a good read."" Always a pleasure: Great story, not predictable, love the 60's culture portrayedamidst the mystery and action."" Please Note: Only pitched roof covered!: I love the Edition DETAIL's series of Construction Manuals. These books have taken some of the examples from their wonderful magazines series but is much more comprehensive. It covers the history of the materials, construction methods, material properties, example of projects built recently (within the past 10 yrs) and drawings of the enlarged details precisely and clearly labled. The price is a bit steep but I believe the book is well worth the price because you'll have a hard time finding books like these (concentrated on details) on the market (if you did please share the titles with us). One drawback on books like these is there's a danger the construction methods and details demonstrated in the book could become outdated as the years pass on. Another thing I would like to point out particular to the Roof Construction Manual is the book only covers pitched roof (otherwise I would have given it five stars)."" Consider another case.: When I bought this case, I thought it would be great because I put a lot of stress on my Palm. I was bitterly disappointed when I found out how heavy it was and how hard it was to adjust the tightness of the case. You basically have to bend the edges against a hard surface to desired fit. Also, the grating sound when sliding the cover on and off will make you clench your teeth. It's like scratching a chalkboard. If you're not careful, the Neoprene on the inside will rip off if you force your Palm in the case. If there was a zero star rating, this product would earn it. My Rhino case is gathering dust..."" Better late than never: Just for the heck of it, I'm still using this case around 6 years after I spent the $100 or so for it. I broke my orginal Palm (fell from the car seat to the ground) about 3 weeks after I bought it - late 90s - and bought this case shortly thereafter. I've dropped it several times since and it's never broke again. I did wear out my original Palm IIIxe, my current one was bought on eBay, but I'm still using the same case and would recommend it without reservation. How many times do you get a high-tech item that is still in daily use 7 - 8 years later?"" OK, but...: Well written and logically ordered, this is a good read for someone who hasn't been and is never going into combat. And it's written by someone who hasn't been and is never going into combat. For others who have and/ or are on your way, save your money for something that will be more useful to you in combat. Like toilet paper. You gotta go to know. The author hasn't."" FILLED WITH FACTS: THIS BOOK IS GOOD. IT SLAMES STRONG FACTS AND MUST KNOW KNOWLEDGE FOR ANYONE. THE TRUE LIFE ACCOUNTS IN THE STORY ARE MY FAVORITE PART, BUT IT READS LIKE A TEXT BOOK REPEATING ITSELF TO SLAME HOME FACTS YOU MUST REMEMBER." Goldmine: This book is a goldmine on combat and killing psychology . A must read for everybody interested in physical and mental mechanism involved in the process." just what i was looking for: I lost my original copy of this book, it was great to find just what i was looking for with no trouble."" Not very good information for an experienced designer: This book misses a lot of the knowledge required to effectively use CATIA v5. Also,there are many blatant errors, not only in grammer,spelling, and graphic examples, but especially in the learning examples. A lot of your time will be wasted trying to follow the books instructions for they are inaccurate. Best to wait for a much better book, one with some intelligence behind it, to come along.It is evident that this book was written by an inexperienced author, and was not proof-read or checked for accuracy."" Missing Part: I just received my spindle assembly and was very impressed with it. In fact I agree with most of the other reviews. It seems to be well made and has a good feel to it.However, when I unpacked it, I looked for the missing table insert. After research, I discovered it is optional.While I admit the table insert is optional for larger pieces, most of us are safety conscience and wouldn't consider working with something that put our hands in danger. It is my opinion that the table insert is worth the ten bucks. I recommend you order one as well. (Jet 709539)"" Excellent veterinary companion book: This drug book is organized extremely well for easy use. You can obtain dosaging information quicker than other veterinary drug books with a convenient formulary in the front of each section. It is nice that the doses are separated for large animal vs small animal. The only drawback of this book lies in the drug descriptions in that they are not complete. The specific drug descriptions will provide a general idea of the drug's uses and major side effects and available sizes, but not some of the more comprehensive information that is sometimes necessary."" Clasp breaks, trapping camera inside: Don't waste your money. After less than a year of use, the clapse breaks. This makes it nearly impossible to get your camera out and renders the case useless. (Due to the design, you cannot use it without closing the clasp.) No extra storage space, either."" Arthurian legends meets 'Riverdance': A pretentious work. Kayley and the two-headed dragon are about the only successfull characters the film. Voice actors were obviously chosen according to their fame and not on how suitable they would be for the character . In particular King Arthur is a catastrophy in this respect (Pierce Brosnan) as is his stiff animation, never saw Arthur as such a winp. The computer animations in this film mix poorly with the rest." Perfect for sleep...very relaxing: I love to listen to Sheri Menelli's Light Meditation CD before bed. I find it very relaxing and it helps me to sleep. I practice the light medition in the middle of the night if I find that I can't sleep. It automatically clears my mind and allows me to get a restful sleep. I am new to meditation and find it very easy to relax and learn to meditate." Not Impressed: This is not at all what I expected. It is all the same stuff that I have seen before and there is this guy singing Elvis' songs in the background and he can not sing very well at all. If you are a big Elvis fan, as I am, this is not worth the money. There is nothing new here at all. I was very dissappointed with this purchase. The narartor even makes mistakes. He calls Elvis's twin Jason!!!! It is Jesse!!!! Don't waste your money!!!!!! I gave it one star becausing I had too in order to submit the review." a funny comic collection: This book by J.P. Tommey is very witty and very funny. I reccomend this book to people who like to laugh." Wow!: I bought this book for my Dad as a birthday present because he loved this comic. I read it before I gave it to him, but I had to stop several times because I was paralyzed with laughter! This is definitely the funniest book I have ever read. After I read it, I immediately went out and bought the first book Ate That, What's Next. I was quite dissappointed in it. Then, I reread it about a month later and was in tears again! The simple reason: it's a great book, but this one is absolutely the best and I was expecting too much. Ate That was hysterical too, though just not as funny as Poodle: The Other White Meat. You should probably read Ate That first. Both books are great, and I can't wait to read the new third one, The Illustrated Guide to Shark Ettiquette!"" Postmodern trash.: This is one of those in the new postmoderns style with half the movie filmed in a dim blue light, and most of it shot in rapid film clips that make you dizzy. The dialouge is often unintelligble (a real handicap in thriller/mystery), the plot improbable and the execution ludicrous. Regarding the latter, the filmmakers have the audacity to place characters that are more likely to be found on the boardwalk of Venice, California in 2006 (replete with full-body tatoos, venacular, etc.) than on a sub in WWII. Stay away from this hoax."" Not As Suspenseful as K-19, But Great Thriller Nonetheless!: I wanted to catch this flick when it was at the theatres, but missed my chance and it went away far too quickly. Decided to pick it up based on the plot and the fact that Twohy was directing and am very pleased that I did. Great thriller and quite creepy in it's presentation. Thought that the ending could have been a bit better, but it's generally a tough thing to get an awesome ending these days. Also, the one thing that I really had trouble with, was the fact that for a sub, this one sure was pretty immaculate and sterile. Needed more noise from the steel, that sort of thing. Subs generally groan and expand/shrink in varying water temps. But, that is a bit nitpicky for this definitely must see rental!!! Pick it up, you will be glad that you did!!" It is a piece of junk. It dulls in under 5 cuts. BUYER BEWARE: The blade is the most inferior and over priced I have purchased. I later found a carbide excellent quality blade at a local hardward store that is makita brand and carbide for only $80.00 I suggest to buyers stay away from this china junk and look for a carbide makita brand blade for the close to the same price. disappointed: Seemed old and used. The sticker on the bottle was ripping off and bottle looked dirty. There is no seal on it either. I wont be using it on my baby." A touching, fun and wonderful musical!: Triumphant and successful, Jeanine Tesori's VIOLET soars. The music is phenomenal. Gospel, upbeat, beautiful and touching songs make this a Broadway lover's favorite album. If you love sitting down at night to read while listening to a Broadway album, VIOLET is the one!A touching story, VIOLET is for all."" The Best: I bought this album new way back when, being a huge fan of Nick Gravenites and Mike Bloomfield. I lost the album in the shuffle over the years... I was very happy to find it available again on Amazon.It doesn't get any better than this. OK 'Fillmore in the West' is close, I look forward to finding it again. Ya gotta love that Gibson Les Paul in the hands of Mike Bloomfield. Nick Gravenites is hands down the best white male blues singer of the era bar none. This is a Classic with a capital 'C'. If you could have only one Bloomfield/Gravenites album this is the one I would suggest...NevadaPic" MODULAR POWER: Full modular ( including the 24 pin cable ) is the only way to go.Let us face it. Power supplies do blow. Full modular makes it a snap to slip a new supply into your computer." The Best film I've seen this year: My favorite sport has always been boxing,and next to Ali,in my lifetime,no fighter was stronger,scarier,and more destructive then Tyson.This documentary film is full of heart and compasion,and its a great life study of a young Man who comes from nothing to become the king of the World,earning over over 300million,and then losses it all and becomes the Man he always wanted to be.""Tyson,by Mike Tyson,James Toback"" is the BEST film I've seen this year."" HBO Boxings 24/7 Series is 10X Better at Creating Documentaries: Silly multiple frames make some scenes eerie, old footage that been seen a thosand times before, no real focal point, and all these things add up to a below average documentary. The people who make HBO's 24/7 should go into doing boxing documentaries because their production from video, to audio, to themes is solid compared to second rate documentaries like this ."" Makita beam cutter saw blade - pricey, but effective: The saw blade that came with my Makita beam cutter turned out to be near worthless. It took a lot of effort to ""push it through"" a cut on a 4x8 beam. Out of the box, the blade heated up with the first cross cut, producing smoke. Not so with this 60 tooth carbide tipped blade. Although it is very expensive (as saw blades go) the results that I get with this blade are excellent. It makes a nice, clean, straight cut without producing any smoke - even in cutting green wood. The Makita beam cutter saw appears to be a little underpowered, so the blade doesn't exactly cross cut through a 4x8 beam like butter, but still the cutting rate is reasonable and the results are good. I have not tried any third-party saw blades on this saw to date."" A Regrettable Buy: I have a generic MP3 player, with which I jog. I needed an armband for it, and this was the only one I could find for a generic product. It is poorly designed, and comes loose easily. My MP3 player is a tight fit in the case, and I can't access many of the buttons, especially in the middle of a run. Mostly I stick it on shuffle repeat and hope the volume stays constant from song to song. I wish I hadn't bought it."" by and so: this innocuous namby-pamby non-sense could be filled with dare i say more substance. cut and paste a segment from each song on the album into one magnificent song. now, thats worthy of several stars. actually what am i saying, the first song is one of my favorites ever. the rest don't quite give off the same complete feeling. i guess after the first i just wanted to hear more with the remaining and thats just not the case. i'm adding some more stars right here. ***" I GOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR...: I wanted a case that did not add to the size and weight of my Palm and that protected it from falls and scratches. That's exactly what this case does. Light and thin so that it still fits in my shirt or pant pocket." Faint Praise: The pros: it is lightweight, effective protection.The cons: its sharp aluminum edges and crude clasp are uncomfortable to the touch and can scratch your PDA. And in my opinion it's rather clunky and not attractive in comparison to the Palm Hardcase."" A Month in Front of the TV: Attempting to add up the meagre elements that enabled me to endure this, I came up with only two: the Lake Como scenery and the fact that Uma Thurman looked very pretty. Vanessa Regrave was her invariably annoying self; Edward Fox was appropriately dreadful as a hopelessly dreadful male lead. The motivations of the characters covered the full range of silliness, desperation, repressed lust, cynicism, opportunism and meaness, none of them conveyed with either style or conviction. With all of that going for (or against) it, ""A Month at the Lake"" still managed to be remarkably slow-paced and boring."" Poor plot, but really poor quality picture: The plot is unrealistic and rather poorlly executed. Acting was strictly mediocre with the sole exception of Vanessa Redgrave who played the older woman very well; if not for her I would have given this 1 "" A Month By the Lake: Loved ""A month by the lake"" which I saw years ago, and I recently visited Lake Como in Italy and the Villa del Balbianello where this movie was shot and walked every path and looked at every view seen in the movie.....loved seeing it again, a beautiful story and well as visually stunning..... it was the reason I wanted to travel to Italy and Lake Como......"" Month By the Lake: This is an okay movie. The scenery is beautiful, but the story line is just okay. I think they tried too hard to make another ""Tea With Mussolini,"" but it didn't work. The actors did a fine job, but Edward Fox just didn't cut a romantic figure for me." Essential early TNH.: Let me start by saying I have deep respect for Thich Nhat Hanh and don't begrudge him the profits from any of his vast number of books. That said some of his later work is pretty watered down and comes of as hippy-dippy.This book is just the opposite. Having read Anger and Teachings On Love I was really looking for something that got to the core of the man's teachings and this book does without wasting ink or time.If you're interested in mindfulness this is the volume for you. Nice way to cook: No more melting spatulas! Love the colors (easy to remember which size is which) and the way they work!" Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2006: Very dissapointed, If you have the 2004 version don't waste your money on this one."" disappointing: Truly disappointing film. A good starting linestory, wasting good actors; I saw it on TV and the DVD has a different ending missing scenes while adding others that are irrelevant. A waste of time and money."" First edition: This was a required book for a research class taught by a social psychology professor that went to school with the author, I think. I have the first edition that probably cost me $20 to $30 brand new. I just pulled it off my bookshelf again after 10 years since it's original publication and it is timeless. I've taken several graduate level research classes and even have a research publication of my own and this remains my ""go to"" book. I had forgotten how funny this book is and the examples and exercises are wonderful for first time research students. Great book and a must have for research beginners and pros."" Good quality, nice price.: This arrived way before I expected it to, and it's a pretty good quality jik-do (I take Kum-do, the Korean form, rather than Kendo and because of that may use different terms) and my intstructor approved of it. The bag was a touch dissipointing, didn't realize I would have to remove the guard everytime I used the bag, not sure if thats how all bags like this are? Overall though, it's pretty much the same sword I would have gotten from my instructor, and with the bag added for 5 bucks, totally worth the time and money."" Scent is strong: I love the packaging, it's easy to control the amount you're using. I love the product - nice feel & glide without ending up greasy. However, the scent is strong, somewhat akin to baby powder. If you are looking for a low or unscented product, I would avoid this one."" Matches KitchenAid Red Mixer: The red one matches my red KitchenAid Mixer to a tee. It looks like I did it on purpose but I didn't. Now, you can."" Better Choice for Beginners: I have this record, listened to it several times, but I always end up taking it off - bored. Lots of creativity but not alot of coherence. FSOL's ""Papua New Guinea"" will give you a much, much better idea of what these guys are capable of - a classic. But - check out the masterpiece - ""Orb's Blue Room"" on ""UFO Orb"" - both the 17 min. ver. & the 40 min. ver. if possible. I still find this beautiful & powerful - lots of musicianship & creativity and an amazing sense of overall flow and structure."" Beautiful Music...: For Christmas this year, a friend announced he would buy me any CD I chose. Frantically I searched for the best way to spend his money, and I came up with only one CD, Orbital's ""In Sides"". Unfortunately, it was sold out at the store we went to, and I found myself drawn to The Future Sound of London. I have Accelerator, their 1996 CD which cators to the masses a little bit more than any of their others, and on a whim I chose this double-CD. And man, was I blown away. Even on first listen I was confronted with beautiful, complex music which demanded that I listen to it. But there is one thing to note: this is not background music. This is music that demands you pay attention, because it is something much more intelligent and diverse than the Top 40 dribble which we are constantly being spoon-fed. Challenging, beautiful, and without a doubt, something which not all who listen to it will understand."" ammmmmmazzzzzzzinnnnnnng: it just takes u away. u'd like to touch ""the sound""? there's an amazingly simple way. buy it and just listen to it!" Great! A+++: Well written tutorials. Guided me through the GibbsCAM program. Definitely reccomended.Steve" What a find!: I'm about 2/3rds of the way through this collection of stories and after most of the tales I think to myself, ""That one was my favorite"". Thank goodness they are short stories or I'd never be able to put this book down.This is my first book by de Lint, and my first exposure to ""urban fantasy"". I am delighted. It is almost Twilight Zonish- you feel that some of these things really could happen, and that they could even happen to you. As I've grown older I was moving away from the fantasy genre, but this has reawakened my love of magical possibilites. These are real characters, partially in a world I'm familiar with, touching on worlds I wish existed.I've already bought other copies for two of my friends. I highly recommend picking this one up."" Simplistic: While de Lint's novels usually carry depth and great characterization, this collection of stories does not. The vast majority of the included fiction can easily be summed up:""Do you believe in magic?""""Nope""""Now?""""Yup."""" YUK!: I always thought of myself as a die hard de lint fan. I died but I went to hell. I can't understand what happened between moonheart and this but you can feel the magic wanting to break through and being bogged down in politics. I'm sorry, but I can't really find anything good to say about this book other than it had his name on the cover. I'm going to cry now in a corner and hope he produces something a little less....dry in the future"" big chaka fan: being that i am a huge chaka khan fan,i have to say that i enjoyed this dvd. on the other hand, i had to give it 4 stars because it was so short and the back up singers seemed a little off key at times. all in all chaka can do no wrong in my eyes. so if you are a fan, i recommend buying this." DVD Quit Working: We've had this unit less than 18 months and the DVD no longer reads discs. The manual is useless and support from GoVideo is nonexistent.I will never buy another GoVideo product. Chevy: It was recommended to me in another book. It gave all the information that I wanted to learn. It is well written and easy to understand. I recommend it highly." Director put some efforts in it: The movie is okay. It starts right in action and you get whole hour of boredom until the moment where cards are revealed and you know what is actually going on in the movie. The special effects are not the worst and far to the best. However you can see, that the director actually tried to make the special outfit for the special forces and the graphics as told before are not bad. The monsters are boring looking however they look like monsters and it seems like he put some money in it. One of the actors had a very funny voice, hew was my favorite actor from the movie. Funny thing that when you think this movie has another hero, it actually does not and therefore a movie has some twists. I was thinking it is about aliens but no, closer to the end where truth gets revealed you realize it is far nothing to do with aliens or mutants. Well I watched the movie, and it got me bored to be honest, however you still can give it a chance."" Excellent book about the subject of Mystical Experience: Many years ago I had a mystical experience which completely changed my life and my way of thinking. Since then I have read many books on the subject. Many have been good scholarly works. One of the best books was Richard M. Bucke's, ""Cosmic Consciousness,"" written about 1901. Louann Stahl's book is the first book I have read that I feel explains adequately the feelings experienced and knowledge gained from having a mystical encounter. She clearly understands the mystical experience and captures, as well as can be captured, what they are, how they occur, and what a person feels like who has had one. This is a modern day, ""Cosmic Consciousness."" I highly recommend it to all people who are consciously moving along the spiritual path. They will find this book most enlightening." DVD sound for blu-ray??: I was disappointed when I realized this music title has no lossless audio track. Dolby digital only for a music blu-ray?? It's a big joke. It's like SD sound with HD vision. The UK version has DTS-HDMA 5.1 " Save your money - there are better La Bohemes out there!: La Boheme is one of the most popular operas, making the top 5 together with La Traviata, Tosca, Le Nozze di Figaro, and Carmen. So it's no surprise that the music industry has produced a steady stream of recordings to capitalise on this sweet romantic story.The film with Netrebko and Villazon is frustrating for both technical and artistic reasons. Mimi requires a full lyric soprano voice and Netrebko has it. But her rendition is unpolished and slovenly, with scant attention paid to the requisite Italianate style, with questionable choices of phrasing, and with recurring mistakes of enunciation. I am not a big fan of Villazon, not so much because of his voice as because of his tendency to over-act...his Rodolfo is too playful, to the point of becoming a caricature of Rodolfo." Think Like a Man: I Love this movie! I laugh from the beginning to the end. Everyone should have this movie as part of their collection. This Movie Was Enjoyable: I really enjoyed this movie. It was a very funny movie and worth seeing. I would watch it again and again." I'm Thinking: I didn't watch the movie right away, but when I did the DVD was defective. So there's no good reviews about ""Think Like A Man"", coming from me."" I like movies: As someone who likes all kinds of movies, I thought that this selection would be a worthwhile watch. It was pretty good ."" Think Like A Man: It was a nice movie, but it was not as funny as I thought it would be. I loved watching Kevin Hart in this movie he was funny and made the movie enjoyable." Haha!: I could not wait to see this movie! I am a huge Kevin Hart fan and knew he would deliver! The movie was absolutely hilarious and the ending was super cute!" Love it!: Love it, love it, love it. Have not stopped playing it since it arrived and haven't gotten sick of it yet either. I bought it because I heard just one track briefly on the radio - bit of a gamble but it paid off. Great to drive to! Love the fast violin playing and the french horns. Rameau was one cool dude. Can't wait to share it with my dad. Am even wondering if I could wire the garage for sound so we can listen to Rameau while working there over Christmas! (Sorry this is not a high brow, classical music critic kind of review with lots of technical observations - I'm just a passionate classical music lover speaking from the heart)."" A class of its own: It was quite amazing that it took me 30 years before Rameau came into my conscious awareness. Well - I was not quite into baroque music - but this CD changed my perception of baroque music quite dramatically.This CD took me completely by surprise since I chanced upon it, and I have been listening to it almost non-stop for the past 2 " why a 1991 " Compared with Relax- By Dr Patrick McCarthy: This book has no comparison with Relax: Say Goodbye to Anxiety and Panic by Dr Patrick McCarthy. The McCarthy Way is a cure for anxiety using self-hypnosis. Its easy to read and the CD simple to follow whereas this book, although useful is too verbose, too strung out and does not deliver the expected results"" Where Do I Begin...: This album is incredible. It will keep your attention for days on end and NEVER get boring. The Raw, Emotional vocals/lyrics, combined with hard hitting guitar and drums makes Fall Out Boy this years ""It"" band for pop-punk/emo. Plus I heard they were on tour with MEST...can't beat that..."" Very uninspired and boring.: I decided that it was time to get a Fall Out Boy CD and I picked this up two or so days ago seeing that I liked all of their singles from their other CD, From Under the Cork Tree. Boy, was I crazy to do so. All of the songs, save for Grand Theft Autumn (Where Is Your Boy) and Homesick at Spacecamp which are very average at best, are terrible and they sound the same.I must say that I'm TERRIBLY dissapointed with this release and don't see how FUtCT could be any worse. I'm scared to buy another Fall Out Boy CD now..."" Ok: Fall Out Boy are going to be one of the biggest bands around in 2004, no doubt about it. They are very talented musicians. But the problem is that this cd is VERY unoriginal. They use the same chord progressions that every other pop punk band uses, and the chorus for song 12 "" THIS CD TOTALLY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I first heard about this cd when i was looking at the review for another cd. I went out and bought it just to check it out and i havent been able to stop listening to it ever since. The lead singer has an awsome voice. This is one of the few cd's that you can listen to all the way through. My favorite songs were ""Grand Theft Autumn/Where is Your Boy"" and The Pros and Cons of Breathing"". Please buy this cd. you won't be disappointed."" Don't hate the fact you like this album..: This album is a good album, despite what all you doubters out there think. The melodies are good, the riffs are fast and catchy, the lyrics thoughtful and while it's not been spectacularly produced, it is still a good album. While we know everyone out there isn't going to like this, I can't understand all the anti-FOB material in the reviews. If you genuinely dislike this band, then don't listen, sell the CD, and most of all, don't write a damn review about them. If you hate the fact that you like this album, don't, for the reasons I have listed. If, on the other hand, you dislike it because you don't want to be seen liking pop-punk (which this album is not, anyhow) or emo, then grow up. More of the same, please, Fall Out Boy." Would not buy: Purchased two of these chairs and I cannot recommend. The chair is not worth the price. One of them broke within a few days of use. Was able to get a replacement thru Mac Sport after I paid for the shipping cost." Ds game: My grandchild loves this game plays it constantly , him and his brother play against each other all the time"" Good stuff: My son plays this non stop. But as with all of these types of games eventually they get tired of it. I would recommend it, it is fun and entertaining and my 6 year old loves it."" Quite fun: I haven't finished the game yet, but so far this is the best game I own. The only thing is that World 1 "" Awesome DS game, but....: I love it I really do. The most fun of Mario games but not the best in my opinion. There are some problems like the saving part. I can't save much data because some parts of the game only allow you to save data like the mushroom houses. Overall it's not that bad once you geat use to it."" classic!- could not put it down...passed it and passed it again =): This game is so much fun. It would be a plus if there was more cool features but it had plenty, i guess i am just being greedy because this is a game i played when i was growing up and now its nice to play it again with better graphics and other improvements. oh and most importantly, you can play with your friends multi player game option thats going to keep you guys busy for hours- laughing and screaming, its great!- its too much to explain in terms of what makes the multi player so awesome but it is, it really really is."" One HAPPY Little Man: My 7yr. old spent some of his Own Money, and bought this game. He is SO Excited!! He Loves it! Your Ad said Very Good, and this thing is LIKE NEW. Thank you SO much! The shipping was pretty fast, the packaging was ok, but Over ALL, You did a Great Job & Made my Son HAPPY, so Thank YouI will buy from you again!"" The fun game set kind of simple: Not only is this game set kind of simple,but it's mostly like Super Mario World. It's innovative but not like the first three mario games, I give it a 4 out of 5 it's original but has a few weak points. On the plus side however doesn't amount of stages." New Super Mario Bros.: This game is classic mario style but with all of his cool new moves and some new power ups like the Giant mushroom. Game play is fun and easy for kids (platformer). Colors are vibrant and shading is flawless. Also features vs. mode and mini games that are especially fun to play with the stylus. My son and I really liked this one. To bad he lost it just one month later. Downside to such small cartridges. Never received product from seller: I never received the product from the seller. Thank goodness it wasn't a birthday present or Christmas gift. My son did have this game at one time though and loves it." Game: Great game, same style as old school and basic buttons not much to it but its still fun to play for hours" Fab-u-lous!!!!!!!!!! :D: I would say this game is so excellent that even a person who hates Mario games would love it. I recommend it for all ages. Just the thing that makes the game spicy is that at the end of the game you have to go through Bowser's castle and the bar at the bottom of the screen doesnt move. Which means you have to use your thinking cap for the last level. Hope you enjoy the game if you get it. :-)" Alabama at their best: i have followed this amazing group since the first started on the west coast. caught them the first time on one of those ""star search"". saw them twice in one evening at Knotts Berry Farm. I was hooked. their songs go right to your heart and bring back childhood memories."" Delightful story: I read this tonight with my son. He is 7 and he read most of it aloud to me - that is when he wasn't giggling. It is a very sweet story about a loving mom who understands that kids are perfect even when they are not ""well behaved"" all the time."" too old and fuzzy: The picture was hardly ever able to show up clearly, and the sound was too fuzzy sounding. I like the DVD version better."" SLICK WITCH RIDES HIGH AGAIN: Another great work from one of the most uncredited bands in American hitory. This is intellectual music. It rocks, it flows, it takes your spiritual being on its jollyway to find the universe. on your journey, you meet some of the best music ever made. This is a wonderful album, much like the first, but I think the first one was better. A SPIRITUAL GREETING shortens the extended musical jams, and sheds much of the progressive style of its predecesor. An excellent commercially accessible stab at progressive rock that all prog fans must have in their collections."" Unimaginative!: Every single cover hews so close to the great Marvin original, it makes me wonder why any of them bothered to go to the effort. Might as well have stayed home and sung to themselves in the shower. If you're going to create a collection of new recordings of beloved songs by such a brilliant and groundbreaking singer and songwriter as Marvin Gaye, fer chrissakes mess it up and create something new!" u need this: you need this if you do the maintenance on your vehicle i tried to do the back breaks on my 08 mustange and came to a dead stop when i could compress the calipers so i did some research and got this and when they came in i felt like a man again it took me 20 min to do the rear breaks after i had this tool set.............thank you Professional Disc-Brake Caliper Wind-Back Tool Kit" Useful tool for anybody working on brakes: This tool is especially useful when working on rear disc brakes (c-clamp works fine on front calipers). I bought it to work on '08 Mazda 3. Sadly, there's no direct adapter for the car, nevertheless I was able to use the tool and it made replacing brake pads much easier."" Gets the job done: I spent an entire Sunday trying to replace the rear pads on my '08 VW GTI, going back and forth to Sears and Autozone looking for the right tool. Then I ordered this set and once it arrived I got the job done in just over an hour.The reason I'm not giving five stars is that it is made of low grade metal - it has a good plated finish on it but is low density and feels cheap. And its not high precision, the pins kept slipping off the piston face and I had to reset everything a few times to get the piston all the way in. I would have preferred to pay a few extra bucks for something higher quality that's made in America or Germany, but this is the only thing readily available and is good enough to get the job done."" Si algÃºn dÃ­a me envÃ­an este disco, harÃ© una crÃ­tica: Hace casi dos meses que lo pedÃ­ y aÃºn no lo he recibido"" The universe Season 5: When you compare season 5 with season 2, 5 is a ripoff.Season 2 "" Great Movie!: This movie had a good story, although the gorilla looks a little kiddy at times, this movie is not made specifically for kids. If you're under 4 you would probably wet your pants. But for the rest of us, it's a pretty good movit. The DVD is presented in an aspect ratio of about 1.90:1 " Nice: This is a nice well produced film. Fun to watch with the whole family. I recommend buying this film.You won't be disappointed." great movie, thought about it all weekend!!!!: THe first thing I did when I got home from seeing this movie at the theater was get online to see when it came out to video. I was pleased to find I only had to wait 3 weeks! I probably will go see it again at the theater, though. I cried at the begining and at the end, I laughed, I was angry. Alot of emotions for this film! Great music, and great African song !!!!!! Thumbs up"" Sound track saved this movie: Yes, it's predictable, yes it's another save the chimps movie. But the story is pretty good and the sound track is drop dead wonderful. I've probably watched 200 ""Dolby Digital"" movies at home and I can count the sound tracks that really impressed me on one hand. This is one of them."" wrong samples: The samples linked on this page are for a band named ""Even Song"" who just happen to have a similar album title as Saddar Bazaar, ""Path of the Angels"", though the bands could not be more different. Do not base any opinion of the actual album ""Path of the Rose"" on these song samples!"" Princeton's Printer Messed Up: This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband, and I'd love to be able to review it. However, when he started reading the book, he realized very quickly it had nothing to to with the cover!It turns out Princeton's printer had placed this cover on the text of a different book - one on economics by a different author with the same surname. I've had to send the book back. I've never seen anything like this before. You would think someone would have double-checked the production run.I'm not sure if all of Amazon's copies of this book have the same problem, but they might want to examine their stock!"" Not the quality I expected: I purchased this thinking Body Glove was a quality product, but after only a few months of use the interior clear plastic that covers the display screen came apart at the seams. Also, the clear plastic never seemed to stay in place while using the phone, it would always ride up and cover the receiver/speaker; you would have to either constantly push it back down so that you could hear the other caller or take it off altogether."" One of the best flat irons you can buy on the market now: HI potential customers if you buy this flat iron you wont have any regrets it does not burn, synge, dry out and damage hair at all as a matter of fact I found this tourmaline iron to do just quite the opposite.It makes hair re-conditioned, moisturizes and makes my hair shine and much more supples. I have relaxed black hair and found it to give my hair that professional salon look especially after I washed my hair at home without stepping into a salon. I love hot tools products and this is surely a best buy."" Good when it works.: The buttons stopped working on mine, too, then started again. Then, files started getting corrupted so the player would freeze and I'd have to remove the battery to reboot it. I'd replace the files and different ones would cause the problem the next time. I will be buying a different mp3 player."" Well-intentioned tribute falls short: The creators of this Laurel and Hardy ""relaunch"" intended to film a 1990s tribute to Stan and Babe. Unfortunately, it is too 1990's: the action/slapstick is frenetic and loud, hardly the subtle and inventive style of the boys' primary creative talent, Stan Laurel himself.The actors do a fine job, unfortunately the film doesn't allow them to showcase their talent. It's too bad that a biography-type film with recreations of classic Hal Roach scenes wasn't attempted. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain could have turned in wonderful performances.Finally, it's disconcerting to see that this is a Larry Harmon production. True Laurel and Hardy fans, particularly the Sons of the Desert, know the story of Stan and Harmon. Hopefully, his association with their memories will end with this direct-to-video mistake.This film will prove benign to the memories of Stan and Ollie. Thankfully."" Overpriced. Doesn't keep water warm.: I use this product as a stylist. I give pedicures and this product is awful. The ""infrared heat"" is nothing more than a red light bulb that is only warm if you are about a centimeter away from it, but it is bright and is intrusive if you are trying to create a spa like experience. The replaceable foot pads come loose and float around. This doesn't keep water warm even if you start with very hot water, by the end of a pedicure service on a client the water is ice cold. It is not easy to store and doesn't hold very much water. Also the opening for the feet is strangely shaped and made it difficult when giving a pedicure and feet are moving in and out of the bath. I have given two pedicures with this product and will not give any more due to the low quality of this product, its embarrassing to use as a professional. Either spend more for a higher quality product, or find a similar product much* cheaper."" hypnotic = not a good thing.: I tried to read this book. I really did. But I quickly realized that I had absolutely no sympathy for the narrator, and her writing was consistently flat and boring -- rather than ""hypnotic."" I did not care about her, her marriage, her children, nothing. If there's anything good about the book, it proves that the privileged can have singularly uninteresting lives and minds. Before I bought it (I am returning it for a refund), I thought the author was african ... which might have made the story more faceted and interesting. But she isn't, and I am now convinced her name must be an anagram."" Lots of Fun!: Even as an adult, I saw this book and had to play with it. It is made of very thick, sturdy, laminated, cardboard and has only six pages. The book asks you to sing and record various parts of ""Old MacDonalds Farm"" while you are visited by a chicken, pig and bear. John Lund mixes photographs of what seems to be stuffed animals with his own illustrations. I thought the illustrations were very busy, but probably gives the child plenty of visual material, considering the short length of the book.The interesting part of this book was the small digital recorder. The recorder was extremely easy to use--you hold down one button to record and one button to play, and the recording and playback quality was good for such a small size. This book could certainly lead to many hours of entertainment." i love my tamagotchi: i love tamagotchi i got one in the fourth grade and it was the version one it was the orange one with the lolipop thingys and in the 5th grade i got the version 2  I returned them: These were huge! And they looked like the paint had come off the face and someone had tried to repaint it. Definitely not worth what I paid for them. Born Too Late: I am 44 years old so most of this was recorded before I was born. I am discovering this whole new world of jazz. My music taste are all over the place but I find myself coming back to Hamp & Oscar. I put this in my CD player at work and have not changed CD's for nearly two weeks. For those of you new to these men this is a great introduction. For those of you who have been fans for a long time thank you for the reviews and leading me to this great music.Do yourself a favor and buy this set." Not bad but could be better: i enjoyed this cd and the production was good, spin the bottle is pure genius i laugh everytime i hear it, but they cant rap as good as 2pac as one person said in their review, not as good as eminem either, so i reccomend you pick this cd up, along with the slim shady lp or the marshall mathers lp...peace"" If you are down with the clown, you'll love this: believe me, if you like I.C.P. you will like TWIZTID. I saw them in concert, right here i worcester, MA. The Cd wicked, especially second hand smoke."" Unfortunately Poor Sound Quality: While I love Sarah McLachlan's voice, the sound quality of these CDs is abysmal, making it difficult to enjoy. The spoken words in between various songs are so quiet that it's impossible to hear what she's saying without turning up the volume.The audience screaming and applauding come through quite well, unfortunately.I was so disappointed with this CD. The songs are great, but they're also very soft in the recordings and I need to boost the volume (again) when playing them in a mix with other recordings.If you want a collection of her CDs, skip this one and stick with the studio recordings." Hallmark Card Studion 2006: Works great. Like printing options. Would like to be able to change graphics beyond clip art." Would you like your music served chilled ?: WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!! This is by far my favorite ambient cd of all time, and I might add the cd that first got me into ambient as well, around three years ago. Be sure to check out track number 3 by Seefeel and track number one by Spacetime Contiuum. Very dreamy. Not for impatient people." Mask of Apollo only good for the interested in greek history: i thought the mask of apollo was a dull book that was hard to follow i was to read this book for a school project and although i am able to follow most books i found this one most strenous to read. I am not at all interested in greek history and was amazed at all the talk of homosexual affiars. I would not recommend this book for any child under the age of 18 who has no interest in histroy. i would recomend this book to children with devoted interest to history and who are good at reading comprehension and to adults who are interested in greek history." WOW WHAT A BAD BOOK: the mask of apollo rates right up there with the rest of the crummy books i have had to read for school. it was one of the most horrible, boring, unimaginative, bland, uninteresting pieces of trash i have ever read in my life. it smelled so bad it had to be fumigated. i hope somebody gets the bright idea to write some cliff notes to this book so that poor souls like me that have to read this for school do not have to actually read this if a person can be found that has the ability to sit still and actually read the chapters. i couldn't. what i did was read a sentence on each page. hey i wasnt missing much anyway."" Tiny: I was kind of disappointed with this because it's really small. I don't think my toes are fatter than anyone else's but this ring cannot fit even near the base of my toe. I have to put it on the smallest part and even then the adjustable part doesn't come close enough to be secure. I can't even get it past the nail on my pinky finger. I have a feeling it will either break or im going to lose it. It also disappointing because I was looking for something that would be secure and sturdy. It looked in the picture like it would be something that would meet my needs. In reality, it's really just a sliver of silver that's tiny. It did, however, arrive pretty quickly." Let down by the writer: Sarah is let down by here writer here. Even she can't carry off some of his more banal trash. Watching the interviews in the specials I wanted to shake him out of his smugness. Riding on the coat tails of a potential comedy star his banalities drag down her performance especially in the third series. Skip this set and check her out on Larry Sanders show where she shines under the light of competent writers." BIG, Fast and Quiet: Pros:- Easy to install.- Print quality is excellent.- Fast and quiet for an economy color laser.- Prints excellent color photos much cheaper than inkjet.Cons:- Be ready for size shock, it's big.- Not very fast for Black and White"" simply beautiful: if you're a fan of Lifeforms or FSOL in general this is a must have. remixes of the title track from the album of the same name, paths 1-7. the thing thats most exciting about these remixes are the additional vocals from singer Elizabeth Fraser, her gorgeous voice meshes perfectly with the earthen vibes present in the music. Future Sound of London out did themselves with the Lifeforms and these remixes are the compliment to the album, if you have a brain in your head you'll scoop this up. PEACE" Oh at last I have found this game again: I used to play this you on the mid 1960's and loved it no one getting killed shot stabbed or high jacked just good clean family fun get the kids playing proper games again brilliant I am buying for my grown up kids" Poorly Made: After a month of use, the charger connector broke. Luckily, the broken piece was easy enough to pull out of my phone.The connector appears to be ""snapped"" together using friction-tabs instead of glue or screws. I suspect all of these chargers will eventually suffer from problems." It works...: I have the W810 and this charger works perfectly with it... I'm glad they finally changed the image..." Best Swat game yet!: This was the best swat game ever made by Sierra, I own the other games and did not like them that much, this one has nice graphics and very realistic. I liked it a lot. The only thing I did not like is that it should have had more missions. Other than that I think this Swat game is really good."" Hoping for more stamping DVDs like this...: This was great, especially if you need to have your stamping classes at home. Mary Jo's presentations have a lot of clarity and a very relaxed approach to creativity. Since I rarely get to see people actually doing techniques, I really enjoyed watching the processes happening in such detail since it was longer than the videos I've seen. The DVD format gives a lot of flexibility in viewing and Mary Jo has a friendly presence as she provides numerous tips along with the project at hand. I hope Page Sage will produce more in this line of product." diabetic coma: I've read through these recipes thoroughly and find I would be in a diabetic coma if I ate the amounts of sugars in them.I would not recommend this book for the true diabetic. It's more a diet weight loss book with recipes for low fat foods than it is for diabetics." Fantastic for one-time use.: You know that terrible feeling you get when you're chewing a delectable piece of the best, most premium burger you've ever had, and suddenly you hit a splinter of bone that pulls you straight back to reality?Now you can have that feeling with everything you ever put grated cheese on! I second (third....fifth?) the other reviewers who note that this grater grates well - for a little while - until the clear plastic degrades into an array of shards delicately clinging to the metal grater they once held.I never washed mine in the dishwasher, or dropped it, or manhandled it, and the clear plastic has degraded to the point that it does indeed dropinvisible pieces of plastic in the food as you grate.Again, I can't recommend it."" you must have it: I own 3 different microplane graters, and they are incredible, if you like to cook, they are essentials in your kitchen." Bad smell: I don't really like it. There is bad smell came out of the cushion which made me wanna throw up! Bad for your health." Dissatisfied: I'm dissatisfied with this bench. It's way too tall, even on the lowest setting, and I'm only 5'3"". The pad also came with spots on the seat. It appeared to be used. The box it came in was all taped up and looked re-used. As long as the goods inside were undamaged and in new condition, it wouldn't have bothered me. But again, the pad had spots on it, and there was no manual or anything that came with it, which I find odd. Even your simple toaster comes with directions or warranty of some sort. If I had purchased this at a local store, it would definitely be returned. Unfortunately, I don't want to have to pay for shipping to get a new one when the bench itself was about $30. I'm going to have to think about this one..." Good one!: This keyboard bench was very easy to assemble and it had numerous height adjustments which I really like. I have it at the highest possible height for my seven year old son and I can easily see him using this for many years. The only possible con for this product is that it does not look as classy as a wooden piano bench. Great Quality: I read all the reviews and decided to listen to what the consumers were saying. I went ahead and bought it for my 6 yrs old daughter and I'm very pleased with the product. The bench is very comfortable and sturdy. I was expecting it to be shorter but it's true to size. Glad I purchased it!" Thomas and Sarah: The series indeed is as much of a social commentary as downright entertainment that urges one to watch the next episode. I would recommend the DVD to anyone who enjoyed the prior series (Upstairs Downstairs)from which these episodes were derived. Thomas and Sarah are two somewhat devious, yet well-meaning (alas for their own benefit)and lovable characters whose adventures are never without unexpected twists and turns. My only regret is the last episode which ends tragically and leaves one a bit confused as to Sarah's future...a most unsatisfying conclusion. As I understand, however,4 more episodes were planned, but were not filmed due to a stike of some sort. Nevertheless, the entire series is most intertaining and well worth the purchase price."" Very useful book: This book was great! Alot of non christians and christians as well would argue its teachings but like it said in the book,""Your future happiness is in the hands of your children."" We should learn to train our children correctly in love and with the ways of God." Great tool.: Just the tool you need to change watch bands. Amazing how easy things are when you have the right tool." Flimsy , poor construction.: I received the product in a timely manner and I was eager to put it to use. The ""pin"" side immediately bent when I gently used it remove a loose pin from my watchband. I tried to gently bend it straight again and the pin just broke off. I think the steel used to build this tool is of very poor, cheap quality. Oh well, you get what you pay for." Great little tool: Works amazingly well. Also useful for enlarging pin pockets at ends of Italian leather watch band. I highly recommend this tool." Get what you pay for: For the price of this item , it's alright.Metal used seems low grade.The fork is large and useful for watch bands like Seiko divers. The push pin works but seems soft and can be bent.Calibration on the ruler is accurate though.Ergonomics are right and would give the novice user confidence to work on a easy to reach push pin.Hobbyist and pros might want to spend the extra money on a tempered steel tool at 10 times the price."" GO TAMAGOTCHIS!: I would really like this toy, but they are our of stock EVERYEWHERE! I am contstently calling Toys'R'Us are Target to see if they got their shipment yet. This toy is obviously popular, almost everyone in my schoo has one."" Never reveived merchandise: I did not receive my order for COCO Chanel Perfume that was to have came from 1stPerfume. I E-Mailed them two times and never heard from them. I know I will never get my $72.00 back that has been charged to my credit card, but I learned a lesson from all this. From now on I will go to a store and make my purchases and have my merchandise in hand. If there is a problem I know I can go to the store and get it taken care of." Fraudlent perfume seller: Should of read the reviews first!!! This coco perfume was fake the label even said Eau De FARFUME and the labels on the bottle didnt even match the real bottle i already have at home i got from maceys I cant believe amazon lets this seller on their web page I have bought off amazon for 9 years and now what??? Im incredilious this happened!!!" A bad joke: My daughter is 3 years old and 40 inches tall and around 40 pounds. All 4T clothes fit her but this was both too snug and too short. The design is very cute but the material is like tissue it's so cheap. The worst part were the ears. I read a review that they were small, and I thought that meant that the ears were like pictured just teeny round ears. In fact, the ears look NOTHING like the picture. The are seriously two humps that are about an inch high. Not circles, more like flat hills. I'm not exaggerating. Had to return it because it was $26, but if I saw it in person first I wouldn't have paid more than $5. I'm really surprised that Disney sponsors this outfit. They must have forgotten to look at the ears, or else they wanted to make sure that parents would have to go to the store to buy ones that aren't as ridiculously inadequate."" Who ever heard of an 19th century heroine called Breanna?: Maybe I'm being too picky, but I get tired of suspending disbelief with romances. A note to Kane: no one in the 19th century would have been named Breanna! It's a misspelled version of a name that would likely have been spelled Briana, if it was used at all in that time period. She's named her characters straight off the top 10 list of 1999. The names of the heroine's children are also utterly unrealistic. Holly? Quinn? The heroines' characters are also overly modern. Liberated women of a certain type didn't exist then. Read Mary Balogh or Amanda Scott, two authors with characters who are a touch more believable. This book does have all the required elements -- romance, sex, a touch of danger -- though Kane's language and plot is sugary. ""Precious"" is obviously her favorite word."" A delightful trio of stories--just right for the season.: Warm, charming stories centered around the holiday theme. Sometimes short stories seem more appropriate with so much to do at Christmas. A good read if you need some ""comfort & joy""."" Not earth shattering, but great for the price!: If you have either DVD-audio or video, I would recommend dropping a few bucks and getting this DVD. As I said in the title, it is not an earth shattering recording, but it is an excellent recording. The orchestra is well up to the task, and the recording itself is near flawless, at least to my ears on my above average sound system. The kicker in all of this is the price. This is a good sign, and I hope that more ""bargain"" DVD-audio titles like this come out soon. There is only an hour of music here, which is the only complain I can have. However, given the price, I would be more than happy to see more titles like this come out in the future."" Little one liked it!: An easy way to get the little one accustomed to playing with fruit and how it looks, but don't expect them to eat the same fruit in real life once done playing here. Fun set to explain fruit with, though." Great quality: My three yr old loves this product. The food velcros together nicely but still easy for her to cut. Great buy." Great for practicing cutting.: I got this for my granddaughter. She started using it around her 2nd birthday. She loved being able to ""cut"" fruits. In the beginning, I had to put them back together so she could ""cut"" them up again but now( at 2 " rn: This outfit made a 4 year old very happy. He can get in it by himself and wears it frequently. The costume is pretty thin but seems durable enough- I would not recommend washing it by machine. The size does run on the small side." Someone Doesn't Know Jack...think it's Sierra: Sierra offers little if any help on fixing the compatibility issue for YDKJ5 and Windows XP.If you want a good laugh, compare their solution to the one Microsoft provides. You don't need a keen eye to notice that one of the tech support people cut and paste from their website, of course leaving out the key phrase ""This behavior is by design."" Beware XP users!"" not good.: i did not like this book. not well organized, missing details here and there, and typos. all these make it hard to follow."" My daughter is a fan: My 9-year-old is a fan of the Doll Hospital series. They are entertaining and keep her reading, so I'm in favor of that. The things she seems to like about the books are the talking dolls and the humor. She liked the baby doll in this book because it was funny and the 2 " Wow! superb product: Superb micro pinner. Easy to use and I am finding uses for this tool that I would never have imagined. Expensive but worth it." Yamaha piece of garbage headphones: very poor sound, the sound of this headphones is worst than any cheap headphoes that you can buy in radioshack or walmart, very low quality like people say in PR, Lo barrato, sale caro, means chaeps things cost you more.."" Just doesn't work: This is a comfortable light to use and the light itself is easy to read by and does not disturb my slumbering spouse, but unfortunately the thing just doesn't work reliably. The issue is the push button switch. When it works, it could take five or six clicks -- or it could take twenty. Or it might not come on at all.If it worked, I'd be a happy camper. But it just doesn't."" Amazing Bass!: I'd had Yamaha computer speakers for years, and I'd always liked their sound -- sometimes even more than my big stereo speakers. Yamaha speakers seem to have a very ""musical"" quality to them, above the normal frequency response ratings and so forth.Lately, though, I'd been feeling the need for more bass after listening to some pipe organ music and some Drum N Bass music, so I decided to get a system with a subwoofer. The first place I looked was on Amazon, and after searching on Yamaha, I found this 3-piece system. Practically every review was positive, so I decided, what the heck, I'll get these.These speakers arrived two days ago, and I've been listening to all my music over again to hear the bass that I'd been missing all this time. The bass response from the subwoofer is truly earth-shaking -- you really feel it in your stomach if you turn up the volume. Plus, the satellite speakers are as musical sounding as I've come to expect from Yamaha, so I'm really happy." Ok WTF why are you reading this!: Ok lol this is the down low on speakers and I know speakers. NO point in reading this just BUY! These MF rock plane and simple. OK LOL since your are reading this I assume that you have room only for three. Not that stupid lol ass 5 or 7 set up they show all the time; or try to push on you at electronic stores. Ack ok you still reading this LOL COME ON! It has a solided 5 stars in Amazon. THEY KICK ASS for 3 system set up if you into Gameing or Music they FN rock no matter what. BAH LOL stop reading this and spend the extra cash and buy these speekers!" Which six plays are we talking about?: Don't you hate book descriptions that leave out this essential information??This book contains: The Emperor Jones by Eugene O'Neill, Winterset by Maxwell Anderson, The Man Who Came to Dinner by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, The Little Foxes by Lillian Hellman, The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams, and Mister Roberts by Thomas Heggen and Joshua Logan."" Excellent book: I love the case studies they are well thought out, relevant, and made me feel like I was in the know. It's a great conversation piece because it puts you ahead of the curve in the area of practical business."" Simultneously hardcore and ethereal: This is a challenging CD with some brutal percussion and some really bleak dark stretches combined with some astoundingly, ethereally beautiful moments. Well worth the journey, and one of my faves. ""Lenny Valentino 1"" is worth the price of the entire CD."" DO NOT buy this blade unless you need 20mm arbor: I received this blade can be only used for 20mm arbor. I had NO USE of it. Seller did not provide enough information, it wasted my time and money."" New cd: this cd is terrible, i have no idea what happened, nofx used to be so good up until pump up the valuum and then this, the only songs worth listening to are franco-un american and the idiots are taking over"" No surround, no hybrid, poor quality SACD: Plays only on sacd players, does not have the 5.1 "" Continuing On A Great Tradition: I haven't read Conan in ages, but I have been a big fan of York's other works and when I saw this one I picked it up. It's a great read! Steven brings Anok to life and makes him breath. The settings are excellent. I'm planning to get the rest of the series as well."" Mount rub agent the transmissing, missing counter weight: I installed this in a 2005 Chrysler PT Cruser. The mount do not extend far enought and rubs agenst the transmission. The rubber is too hard and you feel vibration. The counter weight is also missing. I had to install OEM mounts."" Don't expect it to last: I installed a set over my kitchen sink. I had no problems with the wiring as some others have, and the set really looked nice. I especially liked that I could run the cord down the wall to an available power outlet. Well, it worked fine for about 9 months, then the transformer died.Out of warranty, I emailed Westinghouse from their web site. I never received a reply and now I see that Westinghouse apparently no longer makes this item. No replacement transformer/switch available either. No small wonder why.So if you want something to throw up quickly to sell your house, this would certainly add some appeal to unsuspecting buyers. If you need it to last you any amount of time at all, forget it.Now I get to try to take the wiring off the kitchen wall. After reading other buyer's stories, I don't look forward to this step either."" Quick and easy to install: These lights are easy to install and are great for first floor ceilings where you want additional light. Suggest the you use a laser guide to ensure that the track is straight, it makes the job so much easier. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I would prefer that they be a little brighter. Other than that they are Great. Highly recommend."" Not worth the price, save your money: It does a poor job of trying to cover all WWII women's uniforms. The pictures are few pictures and they are not adequate. A better book for US women WWII uniforms - which includes all the services-is US Army uniforms of WWII, by Shelby Stanton. The chapter on women's uniforms in Shelby is a better reference, plus there are pictures and explanination of women's uniforms throughout the book. Based on the quality of this book I would not purchase other books by Osprey."" A good supplementary reading to the same title from Phaidon: I read this book and another volume with the same title published by Phaidon together. My suggestion is that read the Phaidon book first, then supplement with this one. Phaidon's book catpures the core of Ban's architectural identity and is well-organized by the building materials he used in the projects (paper, wood, bamboo, prefab, and skin). The text in that book is also technical, detail, and informative.Though there are quite a few overlaps between these two books, this book includes more projects than the Phaidon volume. For example, it presents Ban's early works (emphasizing the use of walls), his exhibition installations (from which he got the inspiration of paper architecture), and more furniture house projects.If I can only buy one book, I will definitely choose the Phaidon book and get a copy of this book from the library." His best yet!!!!: Chayanne has really taken a big step up in his music. The emotion given each song made the fact that my spanish is minimal at best unimportant. I wish that his tour schedule this summer was more extensive so that I would have a chance to hear him live. Hopefully we will have more music soon from this great latin artist. This CD is a must buy for anyone who loves latin pop or wants to see what the buzz is about." QuikDrive screws: The quikdrive set up, is really a good way to speed up construction time! These screws are a lot easier to handle, then a bunch of loose screws. I would recomend them to any one." Helpful: The study guide really helped me with my quizzes and exams. Helped to condense the book information into a quick read to ensure understanding of the book's subject matter." Tamagotchi ver3, if you're still searching, don't give up!: These toys are great, tiny, and lots of fun! My sister got some for christmas and I have beeen hunting for them ever since. I don't know how Santa got his hands on them, but he is GOOD! They have been sold out since early December! I think bandai should at least supply enough to satisfy people, they're so hard to find! But there's hope, all you searchers out there! I have 2 " i want on plase 2: hi its me angain thanx 4 restalking but if u can can u make shure that all the new york toysrus stores are foll wit the storwes please and thanx u One star for a great album: I hate to rate this album that bad as the music is really great but you can't listen to it on your mp 3 player without going through all kinds of trouble getting around the copy protection. What does the record company expect ? Make people who already bought the album download the songs again for a buck each if they want to listen to them on their portables. Not me. Boycott this album !!" Don't Buy This CD: I rarely review items, let along leave negative reviews, but the copy protection on this CD prevents it from working normally on many players. Very frustrating to spend $17 on music, only to not be able to play it. Obnoxiousness of this sort should not be rewarded."" Great Album - Copy Protection Not!!!: This is a great album. Music is highly original and unlike anything i've ever heard. That is meant as a compliment! As far as the copy protection goes, I have an Apple iMac running iTunes. It ripped all the tracks just fine. The copy scheme is probably aimed at people using Windows computers. As far as I know, Apple computers are immune to it. Maybe another reason for people to buy Apple computers. Anyway, I sympathize with everyone on copy protecting CDs. If you buy the CD, you have a right to copy it and rip it to mp3, aac, etc. and transfer the music to your portable device. Blame the music industry for the high prices of the CDs and also the pirates who get the music illegally. Don't punish the artists for it; it's not their fault. Write to the music labels via email or regular mail and make yourselves be heard. Please rate the CD based on its music, not the copy protection. Thank you."" Good stuff: I like this record. At times it reminds me of Stereo MCs sprinked with the Verve. Its pretty powerful stuff. The weakest tune is without a doubt ""Running Battle"". I skip over it every tyime.Other than that, a good well-rounded record."" this music made me a baroque afficionado: I purchased this disc in the early 70s. Playing it today reminds me why I becamea Baroque collector and admirer. These concerts, four of them, each with five to seven parts or suites as in the French tradition, are played on period instruments, with clarity, warmth and cohesiveness.....and by the true pioneers of Baroque music.It is the players and their wonderful unison approach who make this musicvery pleasant to the ear. The Kuijken brothers,Barthold[transverse flute],Sigiswald[violin & treble viol] and Wieland[bass viol], the incomparableFrans Bruggen on transverse flute & recorder, Milan Turkovic on bassoon andRobert Kohnen on the harpsichord.......all became well-known in ClassicalMusic circles as Baroque forerunners with distinction. It is a great disc;historically, it's beyond great.The booklet is in English, German and French.Please note.... Sony took over the Seon label and are presently reissuingthis disc and others."" Wow, that's sharp.: I hate zesting. I hate it more than anything in the world. I had the good grips zester, and it was a pain to use. I used a vegetable peeler and minced the strips, also tedious. Then I bought the Microplane Grater. For its zesting ability alone, it's worth it's weight in gold. Several light runs over this device will get you lovely minced zest off a lemon. Not to mention powdery fluffy cheese off a block of Parmesan with little effort.Just be careful. It leaves interesting little marks in your finger if you get a little too excited with it.Buy this, now."" Love the Microplaner!: The Microlaner I bought is exactly the right size for most of my cooking jobs. I have used it on oranges, limes, lemons and ginger. Works great, easy to clean up after I am done."" Does What I Want: This zester/grater does what I want. It is a very fine grater and to explain, when I use it on frozen chocolate, I get a powder. This was what I was looking for because I already have tools that make thin strips. This is excellent for very fine grating.I would caution that this is very, very sharp and because of that I kept the plastic cover that slides over it to protect other things in the drawer and anyone who may not know what may be lurking in my utensil drawer. I may have kept myself from injury a time or two.I have used this for zest, nutmeg, chocolate, hard cheese and other things I can't think of right now. It is not heavy or awkward for me. It works exactly as it should and it cleans up easily. I hand wash mine because it's that easy.I could probably go on and on with a glowing review, but this is something that does one thing and in my opinion does it well, is well made and I'm glad I bought it." Super Zester: This is a fabulous product for zesting. I bought this one for my sister-in-law in England since I love mine so much. I have only used it for zesting lemons so far. The only tricky part is putting the plastic sleeve back on after cleaning it after it has been used. You have to gently squeeze the plastic sleeve on the end and insert it. May take a few tries. I bought one for my friend as well. No more bleeding fingers!" DON'T LOOK FOR A SHORTER ZESTER!: For two days, I surfed the net looking for a short zester that would do what its supposed to do! Not being successful, I settled for this longer zester. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that, in my opinion, this one is much safer--the longer surface provides easier grating by not having to keep my back-and-forth strokes to a minimum. The ridges are sharp--but then, that's what we use a zester for! To ensure others' safety, I have bought a knife sheath to store this tool (they're so cheap, it's worth the protection of this sharp object)."" How did we grate before this?: I don't know how one can cook without this grater! I remember using the other kind for citrus zest and it would just mush-up into a mess with no real ""zest"" to put into a recipe. That never happens with this item. I'm not sure where/when I first got mine, but I've been buying them as gifts for friends/relatives since. Mine is now several years old, is still sharp and works as well as always. Get one-you'll wonder why you waited so long!" This is the best game in the entire world!: This is such a cool game I've played it for hours this is a must-buy!!! Not the greatest and too costly.: The game seemed to drawn out and the graphics seemed right out of the late 90's I felt as if parts of the terrain was missing and keyboard play was a mess. It should be one of those games listed for younger teens after removing some of the more adult content put there to cover holes in quality." waste of good wood: I ""played"" with this at a specialty toy store and was pretty disappointed with it. I thought I wanted this for my son after seeing it online but I'm so glad we got to try it at a store first. My toddler showed almost no interest in it. It looked hard to use and not at all fun. However, it looked like it was well made of good wood and with good stains/paint and finishes.We've had more fun with a plastic food container that I cut a square shape on the lid and my son fills it up with his wooden ABC blocks. BTW, you can do the same using matchbox cars, Peek-A-Blocks, etc. Just use a different plastic food container (yogurt, sour cream, powdered drinks, etc.) for each shape."" Romantic Night ~ J Thompson: I have been a Jazz listener for over thirty years and this is the first cd i bought based on all the ""good reviews from listeners"". I have listened to this cd twice and i confidently do not recommend this cd to anyone. Of course, there is one thing i can say on a positive note and that is it was goooood advertising!!"" One nice tool: I bought this tool because I needed to install flooring, and could not afford a compressor and air tool. And I had borrowed my friend's setup too many times. To my surprise, I found that I preferred the Bostich over the air powered tools. It is light, easy to use, and no cords to trip over. It is not quite as fast as a pneumatic nailer, but for household projects it is more than adequate.Once in great while it would mis-drive a cleat but the solution is to keep the magazine filled reasonably full. It always happened on the last cleat before the nailer emptied.And although this is designed for full thickness flooring, you can use it on thinner bamboo flooring by installing washers between the plate and the frame. This is DIY modification that is not in the manual."" The 50 states quarter folder: It could not see whether it can hold the quarters, until you get and try it."" Excellent Folder For Collecting The New Quarters!: This book contains a stiff cardboard jacket with a plastic slot for each of the fifty quarters inside the front and back cover. The center consists of a booklet that gives information on each of the fifty states. What I really liked most about this is that is the size! The book is aprox 4.5"" X 6.5"" which makes it real easy to handle and store. I bought one of these for each of my children to have. It is much better than the huge cumbersome map they sell on TV!"" saw it in the book store, planning to buy online.: It has a hard cardboard cover with plastic slots on the inside to hold the quarters. Between the covers is about 50 or so pages, with a small page about each state in the order of their entry to the union. There is some basic statistical information about each state. It's a pretty good deal if you are looking for a simple place to keep your quarters. But if you want a display, it's not of high enough quality." Quarters won't stay in - buy a different product: Ditto what others have said. My son has this folder and the quarters will not stay in the plastic slots. As a result most of his collection has disappeared. There are other folders available that are much better. The best seem to be ones where you just press the coin tightly into a cardboard cutout." Quarter Folder: I like the lay out of the folder, but the quarter will not stay in the slots. the Slots need to be a little deeper in order for the quarters to stay in."" disappointed: I ordered this fully expecting it to be the FOLDER as it says. Instead all I got was the tiny book that comes INSIDE the folder, no outer cardboard folder with the plastic molded quarter holders. Now it's going to cost me more to order what I need and none of these descriptions seem to indicate what you really get."" quarter folder: It was just ok, it is very hard to get the quarters in and on one I can not even get the quarter to stay in. So I would not buy any more."" IZflAws: This product DOES NOT RESTORE LEATHER it destroys it. It might be for large gaps as on leather car seats, but It doesn't get rid of cracks"" Tear Mender Cement: This product appears to work very well. A little goes a long ways. One 16oz bottle will accomplish a lot of mending. I was mending an old army tent, and the patches seem to have adhered quite nicely. The product is first class, the seller was great to deal with, and shipping was quick."" Meh...: A very cheap DVD in price and quality. Lots of gore including plane crashes, shootings, warfare, ad infinitum. However, not much of what is shown is well filmed or even interesting.For example, there is a video in which a woman taped herself murdering her husband, but for the 45 second duration of the film, about 5 seconds of it are visible whatsoever. The rest is pitch black. The same goes for much of the footage here. SOME of the footage is filmed relatively well (enough so to please the gore enthusiast), but don't expect much. I spent $2 "" It's Banging...to the Beat!: Luv it, Buy it! The sound quality is awesome! Also looks as cool as it sounds. I am very happy with this product."" Great--but not as good for the new ipods..: I bought this product last week, needing a good sound system for my living room area but not wanting to invest in a full surround system. The sound quality is great, and it works / charges with my old-school ipod. However, my girlfriend just bought a new ipod Nano--it does NOT charge the new ipods, although it still plays music from them. Just beware..."" Worst service possible...stay: away. They sent it to me half packed, broken item. This system NEVER worked!!!! Just looking at it when it arrived, you could see this was damaged. Just save your money and stay away from this company PERIOD!"" Bose SoundDock for Nano Black: I got the Bose system thinking it was the best available. Having been assured that Bose is a high quality product. It has been a huge disappointment. Problematic from the get-go. Every time I take the nano out of it and put it back in, the music will not come out of the nano nor will the remote work - until I've unplugged and plugged the system in numerous times. The slightest disturbance stops all music play. I do not recommend this system for a first time user. Save your money and get something far cheaper."" Amazing: The SoundDock is everything I was hopping for and even more!! GREAT sound quality, the only thing that may look bad is the price but it's totally worth it. Great product and I recommend it a lot. Thanks."" Great sound!!!: Lightweight, incredible sound, and the remote is great! I bought this after returning a cheaper iPod dock that had tinny sound and a bulkier case. Should have gone with the best right off, but I've learned my lesson!"" Surprisingly poor: This book moves at a snail's pace. As ""a novel of the life and times of Wild Bill Hickok"" it does nothing to draw the reader in, and care about the characters. When the extensive dream sequence appears in the middle of the book, I was left wondering what King Arthur and the knights of the round table had to do with Wild Bill. Did I miss something? I suppose this is some inferior use of metaphor, but there had been no effort to set it up, and therefore it lacked relevance.Like the other review here I can't understand how this was a winner of the Western Heritage Award for Best Western Novel. I will stick with Spur award winners from now on. For readers who are looking for true western literature with metaphor and imagery, check out Win Blevins ""Stone Song."" That was a Spur award winner, and one of the best western themed books I've ever read."" Sexy, Stylish Thriller: Ellen Barkin was very sexy and stylish in Bad Company at age 39 (when it was filmed between 8/12/1993 and 10/16/1993). I think 39 is a very sexy age of attractive women. A lot of 39-year-old women have sophisticated high-status jobs that pay well. Ellen Barkin is still very sexy today at 56. Most attractive female celebrities retain their nice, sexy looks for years. I love her sexy short hair in the movie. Ellen Barkin is just plain smooth." PASSIONATE VISION: THE DRAWINGS ARE GOOD ALWAYS EMODINGLY GOOD WITH EMOTIONS EVEN BEARING THE BRUNT OF EXECUTIONS OF TIMES OF WEARINESS TAKEN FROM HUM-DRUM LIVES TO A FLICKER OF HOPE OF LOVE AND/OR PASSION The Dark End of Town: The Dark End of Town--a very engaging mystery which captures the flavor of the rural upstate NY town -- which Ms. Pomeroy has fictionized for the novel -- and adds a twist of mystery and romance --Julia Pomeroy makes you hope she will write more than just two books with this setting and characters." Make sure you need all four of them.: Since each cell will fire around 2000 nails, make sure you'll use all four of them within 2 " Best baby product: I love this product and feel good about using it on my babies. Great smell and great on the skin of your sensitive baby." great nailer: The reviewer from Virginia which gave this tool a poor rating (*)does not understand how the trigger safety or the loading mechanism works. May be he should read the manual. I have owned many different brands of nailers of various types and as a finish carpenter I feel this is the best It has the clearest view of the nail target, that is a safey feature, is the best out there because it is open in front even with the rubber cover on the tip. Professionals rarely complain about a bump trigger(you still have to hold the trigger and depress the tool to fire?) and besides they give you a sequential trip too! Oliless would be nice but it may have a longer life as a lubricated tool. Also it uses the most common senco type nail. You cannot go wrong with this item."" loving insight: Such a good read...Tracy Stewart really provides the readers with an interesting yet loving insight into who the man Payne Stewart really was...not only the golfer, but the loving, God fearing family man the public didn't know! What a tragedy for his family to have lost such a wonderfully loving husband, father, son & brother. And what a great loss to the world of golf...Payne Stewart was just coming into his own...a life cut too short."" Great Book not Only For Golfers , but for everyone: I bought this book because of my best friend . We are two golf junkies from Kentucky . We both have our favorite golfers mine being John Daly , his being the late Payne Stewart. I thought maybe i could one up him a time or too on Payne Stewart , and rib him a little but when i began and finished the book, it inspired me unbelievably . In the book , Tracey Stewart talks about the struggles of life and the PGA Tour. During Paynes fathers death , he was strong and held on to strive . It inspires you not to give up hope when life throws a curve ball at you . The book also shows how spirtuality , and setting priorities on life can help you out tremendously in the long run . Payne Stewart lived a great and inspiring life , and this Biography touches on all aspects of it . A Great book" ePhoto Smile Digital Camera: Fairly easy to use but the resolution was unacceptable. Thepurchase [price] makes it a good buy for a beginner." Not the best choice: I bought the Smile to have a handy, inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages. I didn't want to spend $400 on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months. I figured for $100 I couldn't go wrong. I was mistaken.The Smile just has too many compromises. The lens is a tiny fixed-focus item that requires bright light to form an image. Battery life is abysmal- it seems to chew up a pair of AAs shooting a dozen pictures. I should have spent $200 and gotten a far better camera."" DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!: I would not buy this camera. Several customers have had numerous problems with this item (including myself). I received a call the other day from Agfa saying that they do not plan to restock the eSmile camera. They will give me a refund (after I fill out a bunch of paperwork....when they mail it to me). Honestly, save your money. This camera is a bomb!!!!"" Disappointed: The pictures don't seem to be as good as they should be. The cameria uses batteries quickly, and the flash is inadaquate. The software is simple, the uploading of pictures is efficient, but if it doesn't work, there aren't many diagnostics. But for [the cost] what do you expect? I think just a little bit more."" Worse than I thought, but at that price...: I'm on a small budget this summer, so I bought this camera for fun. It doesn't drain your batteries before you even took a picture(I took about 40 pictures(without flash) with my cheap rechargeable batteries). The four stars missing is for the worst quality I've ever seen in my life. I suggest to never use the flash(all my pictures taken with flash were 90% full of light, so it's all white!)This camera is too cheap(I think that my batteries heavier than the camera itself)You only have to put the Cd that it comes with it and it installs itself.I think uploading my pictures(16) to my pc took 4 minutes!The camera was too easy to use and I wonder why Agfa made these things.Finally, digital cameras are too expensive and someday the prices will fall down and camcorders will take better pictures... you will regret buying this awful camera!"" Embroidery scissors only!: This cannot handle any 4"" scissor, only an embroidery scissors (like the stork kind) that have a small flat screw. I need to keep a small scissors that can handle fabric as well as thread.Pretty, though."" If you loved the movie..don't buy this book!: My husband is perhaps the biggest fan of the movie Vision Quest. He bought this book hoping it would be as good or better and was HORRIBLY disappointed. It was shallow and Godless! You are left feeling disconnected from the main character. You feel like you need a bath after reading it. Seriously, this is not the book you had hoped for if you loved the movie. Save your money on this one."" made in mexico: the quality of this air compressor will only go downhill. when EMGLO in johnstown, pa. sold the factory to DEWALT, they were building a high quality unit. it didn't take them long to ship this work to mexico."" One of the finest boxed sets I've ever purchased!: Burt Bacharach was one of those songwriting talents you usually took for granted. From about 1958 to the present, one of his songs was always on the radio. I had no idea what a mammoth legacy of pop music he's left behind. Without a doubt, he is one of this century's finest songwriting talents. This is one of the finest boxed sets I've ever purchased. My personal favorites are Raindrops are fallin on my head, I Say a Little Prayer, I'll Never Fall In Love Again and about 25 others. They're all here. They recall old girlfriends, heartaches, good times, innocent times, especially during the sixties, when we thought we'd be forever young. If you remember these golden times, you need this boxed set. It'll make you fall in love again. Thanks to Austin Powers, I've rediscovered the magic of Bacharach. Classic American pop tunes. A must!"" Is it really an approved study guide?: Waste my money, waste my time. I buy it because it is the onlyone approved study guide and there is no book review at that time. Itis really horrible. How a 300 more pages training guide can make you pass Site Server exam? It is impossible. Even, it spends many pages talking about materials not Site Server related. How this book can be approved? Don't buy it anyway... END"" ""TOASTER TEASE"": The Toaster worked good for about 6 months and then nothing buttrouble! Un-even toasting, settings not working.Now the right side 2 "" What's wrong with old sex?: Why do we need the new sex? Isn't the old sex good enough? The step-by-step roadmap is missing a few steps if you know what I mean. And some of the steps are too complicated, if you know what I mean." Bucket Hat fits my punkin head: One size fits all hats not big enough for me. This one fits - case closed! It fits: Great hat . I've got a huge melon and this fits with room to spare . Very well made I'll probably wear out before it does . It's reverseable and one side looks as nice as the other ." Not as good!!: I was dancing to the workout but,get lost to fast.So,I stopped after 2 "" Hard to start: This compressor kicks out the overload on cold start ups. With an ambient temperature of 70 degrees and above I don't expect difficulties with start up, but I have to re-set the overload 5 to 6 times with the tanks empty. I had this identical compressor before (it was stolen) and I never had a problem with start-up unless it was below freezing.I am quite disapointed with this item." Died after only one month: I only used this blender for one month before it died (and actually only used it maybe 8 times during that month). I am not very impressed with the quality of this model. I would suggest looking at another brand. Buy another blender: I bought this blender less than three years ago and I am now in the market for a new one. The moter smells when I put in frozen fruit. I have to shake it back and forth just to get it to blend everything. So here I am searching for another one." Very, Very helpful: This book is filled with great ideas and is something I enjoyed reading. I use several of these recipes on my children and myself. My friend borrowed it and loves it too. Only problem is she does not want to give it back! I would buy another copy if need be and this book could make a great gift any time of year." Ok for 99%: This router is easy to setup. It is not a stateful packet firewall. It does not permit private LAN addresses other than on the 192.168 network. It will not allow a statically assigned DHCP address leases (for a print server perhaps).It is fast and has a DMZ port as well as a backup modem port -for when your cable provider goes away.If you dont need the serious features this firewall is probably just fine. Does not hold up outside: Today we had to take down this flag after a little over two months of use. It completely split down the middle and was two seperate flags. This is definitly not a high grade outside flag. Very poor quality: This flag only lasted 6 months and is all frayed wouldn't recommend you ever buy this item. this is not a good flag Excellent product!: A most excellent product. Colorizing was great and the original black and white was virtually flawless." Campy fun: I bought this DVD since I liked Deathstaltker 2. Very bad acting, so bad it is funny. Scantly clad babes and guys swinging swords, what else would we want ?"" valuable resource: This book will be most appreciated by those who already possess at least a basic knowledge of and skill with floral pressing techniques. The information is generally well presented, with numerous color illustrations. The ideas, while beautiful and creative, are aimed for the more ambitious crafters."" Great Research, Bulky Read: In under 350 pages, David Brion Davis presents a wealth of information for those exploring the history of slavery for the first time or for readers seeking additional information to supplement past books and articles.Unfortunately, it reads like a choppy college lecture, with the flow of material marred oftentimes by the circular exploration of material. A topic may be introduced, then discussed in depth later and then reintroduced for concluding remarks many pages later.Davis utilizes numerous resources from contemporary historians and it is appreciated that he introduces the author and the work to the reader while quoting from the material.Inhuman Bondage is an important work in the growing number of books covering the sordid past that has been ""conveniently"" ignored or flippantly tossed aside in past historical writings.By coming to terms with the past and acknowledging the damage it has done is the only way the words from Davis and others will truly have full meaning."" Get Over It, Dude: The Hedgehog. He gives the rest of us average Joes hope for the future. I mean, if this guy can get action, who can't? This documentary about one of the adult world's 'biggest' male stars should have been really something. It wasn't.Ron Jeremy is simply too stuck on the fact that his calling in this world just isn't given the level of respect he would like. As a result, Jeremy has to remind us over and over again about the miniscule appearances he has made in non-adult roles. One episode of some TV show, in which Jeremy appears for a grand total of about two seconds, is commented upon because, well jeez, please notice, it has nothing to do with porn.Ron, you picked your calling. We all have regrets in life and we may empathize with yours. But in watching this flick, I wanted to see about the life you lead, not the one you wish you had. For such an interesting life, this was a pretty lifeless documentary."" This book seems to be clearly biased.: Many of the ""facts"" in this book are clearly in dispute. Other historians and researchers have uncovered evidence that contradicts or even debunks some of the supposeded events. This book seems to try and make the 1921 "" Check with Veritas before you buy.: The system requirements state that a CD-R or CD-RW drive is needed for this program, but beware that not all CD-RW drives (such as my Memorex CDRW-4224) will be supported by this program. Check their website first to ensure that your CD-R or CD-RW drive supported before buying."" World's Easiest Ultrasound Learning Material: If you are looking for some sort of ""Ultrasound for Dummies"", this is it! Forget about all difficult and thick physics and theories. If you open up this book, nice pictures of actual scanning with clinical images will be served for you. Instead of imagination how you get these images, you really can see how you have locate and move your transducer to get the images which is very important to make a diagnosis.I had a chance to discuss with one luminary doctor about easy ultrasound learning material. This is the book which we have chosen for.Very practical and benefitial for your study or daily practice.Other benefit?""It is very handy"" ^^"" Seemed to be an illegal copy: The text of this book was not in the ""correct"" sequence (i.e., the last chapter in this text is the first chapter in the 'real' book), the study guide sections were not present, and the title text of each page was something about indians (native americans)... all very, very weird and ""shady"" to me."" Great spiritual first time read!: This book was recommended by my new church before becoming a member of the Unity church. It was a very easy read but very uplifting...definitely ""soul"" food!!!"" clever and entertaining: For a first novel, I was very impressed. The style is easy and flowing - a cleverly written tale of old and new with a few chuckles thrown in."" Flawed: While she has a compelling argument, one based on sensationalism, her thesis fails to illustrate why the hysteria found in Salem did not occur in other communities that were afflicted with same microbiological phenomena. This monograph makes many assumptions and more often than not her arguments seem predetermined. The amatuer reader will enjoy her writing, but academic historians will be disappointed."" nice nailer: A case would have been nice. Some dewalt things come with a case and some don't, I guess. A air inlet connection would have been nice as well. I had to hunt down a connection in my compressor junk.... glad I had one. I don't have any framing nailers to compare this to so I'm not quallified to rate this item against the competition. The price was nice with the 50 dollar rebate. The air inlet area seems to be machined off center by design (perhaps to keep the airhose from being hit duing recoil), but this caught my eye right away as a flawbecause it just looks crooked(hell, let's face it, it is crooked). I love new tools, so I am overall glad to have purchased this nailer and look forward to nailing!!"" no new info: I bought this book hoping to find information on alternative medicine and on what I should do, instead of the loads of advice on what NOT to do. The alternative medicine chapter was basically a list of things people have tried, but no suggestions on how well they work or on how to implement them. Overall there was absolutely no information in this book that my doctor hadn't already told me on my first visit while being diagnosed with GERD."" They obviously didn't even watch it themselves!: This was a big disappointment. There is nothing on this tape that isn't on other ""opposites"" educational tapes, but there are plenty of mistakes. Shall I start with the fact that the voiceover at times does not relate to what the children are watching (for example, the voiceover says something like ""the boy is picking up the car,"" but there is no car and no little boy. You see the car and the boy much later and without the voiceover explanation. The car that drives ten feet past the stop sign before stopping -- to illustrate the word ""stop"" -- was comical. Examples abound, but need I really say more?I have purchased other products from this company in the past and found them somewhat useful (although far from great) albeit not for the age range it is targeted for. They were educational for my 9 month old baby.I wasn't the only one who didn't like it; my son (2.5 years) loses interest in no time." good: I got it after 3 days when I bought it. But I hadn't received answer of my email from the seller. Get up and trance: This album was actually released first in 1988. So it's not a new album from them as some people think. I suggest getting now while it is back in print. I got into techno in the last year but even so I recomend this if you liek any type of techno. A landmark is the history of house I think" ...: ... When I got this I was expecting some good music, instead it's almost as if I camped out in a Casio forest. If you would like material for history's sake then this is for you. If you want to get it to listen to, then think twice. I was [upset] after twenty seconds of listening to this CD."" Excellent Casters: These casters work exceptionally well for the Performax 22x44Plus, although they should considering the price. They are sturdy, well built, and appear as if they will hold up for the long haul. They roll well(in the unlocked position) and not so well(in the locked postion). I would recommend these for your Performax purchase."" Outstanding breaks!: Love this album, bought it a few times already! Nice bass lines for the sub's in your car! I just wish they made a part 2 " Use it as a stud finder!: Regular stud finders don't work so well with lath and plaster walls. This thing will locate the studs by signalling all the little nails that attach the lath strips to the studs! Also use it to find hidden nails in recyling trim." Finds large screws/nails in wood but not small ones: Tested it out on an 8' long old birch-top workbench. Unit found the screws holding 3/4"" top to the frame. It also found most of the visible nails that had been pounded into the top over the years. The key word is ""most"". It could not find a finishing nail embedded in the top corner of the front edge of the top. I could see the nail with the naked eye but this unit didn't know it was there!!I was going to return it but figured for $20 I'd keep it and use it to at least find bigger metallic objects."" Om Shanti: This album was a dissapointing. The redeeming fact was Tejendra Narayans sarode. shujjhat khans sitar dosent come close I really enjoyed the classical depth of Tejendra Narayan. My personal opinion is Indian classical music is a very deep and intricate art,its not about OMs and Shantis. if one seeking that then they should look in the bhajan section. The same is to say about singing gazals while performing. A great album to look out for is Tejendra Majumdar's Kafi Kannada which can be obtained by Amazon"" Real Good Movie Play!: I really enjoyed this movie it was far from a play. It was funny and truth is this could happen to anybody who's dealing with relationships, internet, love, life kids etc...! Watch it and enjoy!"" Plenty of Good Stuff Here!: This CD was recorded in July 1995 in Hollywood California and is somewhat unique today in that it is a pure analog recording. All tracks, with the possible exception of 3, were recorded direct to two track for that live club feeling. All tracks feature Ry Cooder on guitar and most feature Jim Keltner on drums.The disc itself has a laidback soulful feel which seems typical for slide master Ry Cooder. The standout tracks are J.B. Lenoir's ""Down In Mississippi"" and Terry's own ""Blues No More"" both slow, smooth, soulful and performed with a lot of feeling. On the downside, the CD would get along just fine without ""Money In Your Pocket"" which sounds an awful lot like the old ""Put The Lime In The Coconut"". Over all, with the exception of ""Money"", this is a fine CD with a lot to offer the listener."" Disappointed: Couldn't get into the plot; was very slow-paced and depressing. I was bummed I had to give up on it, but wasn't going to waste my time." Great for a book club title...: This was a book club selection for our ladies group-readable but with plenty of depth and provocative subject matter. Many women were enthralled with Little Women as girls and it was very meaningful to read this now in our 40's." trite, shallow and irrelevant: If you want to read something that is mostly Forrest Gump meets the Civil War, read this. But if you would rather read something that actually says something deep and meaningful about living in wartime skip this book. And if you might be hooked into thinking it has anything to do with Little Women other than a connection by name....well think again. Ugh! Couldn't get through it. Tried hard."" grossly overrrated: Another trite, hackneyed, highly regarded Civil War book---similar to The March, Known World--all three overrated. Good enough reads, nothing great about them. Don't know why this book got such raves. Character of March is not heroic or admirable in the least."" Sky High Price: I had these glasses in my ""To buy"" list since July. At that time, the glasses were $17.99. This price is really high. I think I will wait for a better price. (I should have bought them several months ago.) I love the glasses but $29.99 is high." Damaged Cristal D'Arques Longchamp Old Fashioned: The Cristal D'Arques Longchamp Old Fashioned ordered on 5/30/07 arrived badly broken. A complaint was filed upon receiving broken glasses. Amazon requested that they did not want the return of this package due to the dangers of shipping broken glass. They also promised replacement. We have paid in full and have nothing but frustration to show for it. We would appreciate having this issue rectified. A possitive review is not available at this time." and for THIS you gave up baryshnikov???: there were three of these movies all at the same time; ""places in the heart"" and ""the river"" were the other two. this is the one with jessica lange, instead of the one with sally field or the one with sissy spacek. if you liked one of the other two, you will like this one."" Need size: Crystal D'Arques Longchamp Wine glass has10.25oz, 8.25oz,5.75oz, 4oz, 2oz, 5 different size.They are all look a like and can't tell by picture.I'm looking for my missing set of 5.75oz.I can't buy them without size information.* Edited and addedNow they shows size.FYISize 5-3/4 is 6.5"" tall and 2.5"" dia (both top dia. and bottom dia.)By the way, we see same glasses in many movies.When my wife and I see same glass in movie, we always say ""Hey, they use same glass as ours""."" Buy It: The first review listed is extremely accurate so I would just be repeating already listed info...so read it again. The outfeed table wheel is tough to turn for little hands (I'm a woman) but that table rarely needs adjustment anyway. The optional knife gauge is pretty steep $$wise, so I recommend the Delta Jointer pal 37-157 to align your knives perfectly with each other & the outfeed table. This sells at Rockler for $72.99 but you can buy it at the amazon tool crib here for less. The dust port is large enough to be extremely effective when hooked to a 4 inch dust collection hose."" Trash at best (The CD at least can be used as skeet): Be Warned They CHARGE for Call in support now!!In my opinion; Norton used to make some great products. I used to recommend their Norton Utilities and Anti Virus programs to friends and install them on computers I assembled for them. Sadly, this has changed. They now have an online forum where you are forced to ask your questions. They may even get around to answering your question, but it takes days to get correct answers (if ever). The quality of their software has plummeted also. Several other companies make similar products that are FAR superior. Not only do I not give them a positive review, I strongly recommend you do NOT use them."" Buen producto: Es un buen producto, aunque tiene sus deficiencias pues hay una parte de el que no es tan facil de usar, lo cual podria causar problemas a personas que no tienen muchos conocimientos de computaciÃ³n."" DHEA - amazing information: Amazing book - there's so much information about our body and how it works - the relationship to aging and the body's production of DHEA - If you want to know about healthy aging, read this book.Having taken DHEA for 5+ years, I can say it truly is life-changing."" Did I miss something?: This book won awards? Did I miss something? Sure, the black and white art is incredible. And there is a central mystery that is intriguing. But where is the subtlety in the storyline? It's one bloody fight scene after another. Frank Miller has come a long way from his days of the Dark Knight, Daredevil, and Ronin, and it hasn't always been an improvement. Where is the scintillating dialogue and complex storytelling that marked his early career? I measure a comic's success by whether I want to back to re-read it. I've only read Sin City once, and it's been sitting on my shelf collecting dust a long time"" Interesting art, worthless story.: Two words, actually: Mind Trash.What happened to Frank Miller? The guy actually used to put some thought into his scripts -- Daredevil, Elektra: Assasin, Dark Knight, Ronin -- but now he just churns out blood. Sin City's plots make no sense, the dialogue is cliched and the voice-over narration almost too cheesy to believe.Sin City does feature the best Miller illustration I've ever seen. It's a shame, because if Ronin had been matched with this kind of Miller draftsmanship, it would have been the best genre comic of the '80s.Oh well. Maybe Studio Proteus can package this garbage as manga, since the average Sin City issue only takes about four minutes to read."" Wow!: This is unlike anything I have ever read. It remains as shocking, in many ways, today as it did when originally released. This is a unique literary effort that also happens to be strongly illustrated."" Almost unreadable: First, on style and prose: horrible! Even by official army standards the writing is just dreadful. It is also poorly organized, makes jumps back and forth chronologically, and is very hard to follow. Some parts of text do not match up with the maps on the same page. The authors insist on only using the Army's objective names for key battles and locations, instead of the geographic (and easier to follow) terms. It would be like calling Vicksburg ""Objective Skylark,"" or something.Second: The sidebars often make no sense or are too brief, and the conclusions/statements in the text are often highly questionable. Ex., ""Historians prefer to write about people long dead for a number of reasons. For one thing the dead can't criticize what is written."" The authors make lots of universal statements that don't ring true. This is ""instant history"" at its very worst."" Pretty but not soothing: This is a very pretty lullaby collection overlayed with bird and nature sounds. However, my 16 month old was not lulled to sleep because the chirping noises attracted her attention and she wanted to clap her hands instead. The bird noises actually sound more like early morning chirping."" atrocities eh?: I guess if you're looking for a dvd of old news reels from the 40s then this is for you...However if,like me,you were looking for concentration camp footage,or perhaps anything even remotely entertaining,then I suggest you look else where because this dvd DOES NOT DELIVER.To sum up,spend a few more dollars and get something else."" Uneven Horror Flick: This movie is about a struggling young artist that is the apprentice or servant of an accomplished female artist that just happens to be a vampire, what what she paint with is blood and it is the apprentice's job to get her victims for her. Parts of this movie is good and original, other parts just do not work. It try to mix 1970's psychedelic and artsy vampire movie with humor and it just do not work. I do not know what to think about this movie. I got it cheap and it did entertain me, but I am just left with the feeling what a mess when I think about this movie. If you are a big fan of bad horror movies and vampire films you might get something out of this, just be warned before you spend your cash that this movies is strange and at places just idiotic."" Best Maps Ever!: The Vermont Atlas and Gazetteer (as well as the NH and Maine versions) are simply the best maps I have ever bought and used. Every road in every town is shown, and well as topographical features, landmarks, waterways, etc.If you get lost using this map, wellll, ummmm, maybe you shouldn't have been going there!" quick delivery and the product i ordered: i am very satisfied with the product i purchased and how quickly it was delivered. i will definetly order again." Bad for ME: I personally don't recommend this product for WME users.For my 600MHz computer running Windows ME, IBM included a notice in the box claimed performance issues while running with WME, as well as that important ""direct dictation"" feature for works other than word processing (ie using Excel/Outlook/IE4) will cause crashes. This made it not worth the price, and the risk of losing data.However, it works exceptionally well for 600MHz running Windows 98 including 2nd Edition, for that I will give 4 stars."" Eat-Man 6 Volume Box Set: Here is a wonderful example of someone taking a good manga and completely wasting it. As it stands, very little about this series is actually worth your time; The art is very nice, animated very smoothly and nice line work. Everything else, on the other hand, is pretty pathetic. The music is pretty jarring and doesn't fit the theme at all. The opening and closing songs are totally uninteresting, and both sequences are visually underwhelming. The characters are horribly two dimensional, a mercenary Damsel in distress? Give me a break. There is no character intorduction at all, so you can't really bring yourself to care about anybody, hero or otherwise. Since it is episodic in nature, you never really get any serious insight into Bolt's character, and all the characters that seem interesting are gone in the next episode."" Ghosts with Class!: I loved this series! It's short, with only 12 "" Compatibility issues!: My issue is with the game maker Encore not the game there are too many things that will not let you play version of this game. I had go into ""MSCONFIG"" and shut everything down to even get it to load. And as is the ""norm"" these days you can't get a service rep that speaks English clearly to help find the trouble. I would say find a different company, not Encore to buy the game from. O and their idea of a ""Jewel case"" is a paper envelope wrapped in a piece of card board."" Didn't work: The product did not work, I put the disc into my computer and it turned my screen completely black."" Warning! Do not buy this game.: This is a total waste of money. Game has defects and will not work well on XP. Empire is no help and their forums are a joke ""Help, I have a black screen"" ""I know of no solution at this time."" It is also cd dependant to run, meaning you have to lug a cd around with you if you want to play the game (when it will play). After a day of frustration trying to get this thing to work, the game ended up in the trash. That toss into the trash was the most fun I got out of the game!"" Shame, shame, shame: I loved playing Scrabble as a kid in the 1950s. My new HP computer came with a copy of Scrabble. I played about 4 games and it quit. They no longer support it (bummer) so I went to the net to buy it. Got it from some outfit Amazon recommended. Installed it. Crash.Black screen of death. 3 times. File thirteen. The $10 isn't worth the hassle of returning it. Hope it works for you because it's a great game. But don't try it on a Dell Dimension 8300 Pentium 4, 3.2 "" AVOID if you have Windows XP: Don't waste your money on this game. It would be better to just throw your money in the trash and not risk harm to your computer. Not only did it not work at times leaving me with a black screen at start up, it would also go totally black in the middle of a game and I would have to drag the mouse over the entire screen to make the picture reappear. I love Scrabble, but not this game!!" cd does not work: this cd worked for a few days then it began when ran to give a dark screen and dispite uninstalling it and reinstalling continued to display a dark screen and not come on i would like a full refund for this product it does not work with windows xp" not so funny in retrospect: I remembered this movie as being very funny and when I saw it was available on dvd, I wanted to add it to my collection. Seeing it again, as an older person, and in light of the devastation that violence causes ( and my heightened awareness of it as I've matured), I no longer consider it funny. The part with Dudley Moore being brutalized is not in any way amusing."" CUT THE ELECTRIC CORD: AS A CABINET INSTALLER A MITER SAW IS A MUST. BOSCH'S 10"" 24 VOLT COMPOUND MITER SAW IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CUT THROUGH 6"" HARD WOOD FILLERS AND 4-1/2"" CROWN MOLDING WITH NO PROBLEMS. THE LIGHT WEIGHT AND PORTABILITY OF THIS SAW MAKES IT GREAT FOR PICKUP WORK. ONE BATTERY WILL LAST ALL DAY AND INTO THE NEXT.

GOOD JOB BOSCH."" Poor quality: Be careful of what you purchase in the Cristal D'Arques line. The brandy snifters are poor quality. I suspect that the remainder of the D'Arques line is on a par with the brandy snifters.I purchased two of the brandy snifters to supplement my Cristal D'Arques collection. We have almost 100 pieces of the various glasses, etc. made by D'Arques and purchased over the years. The manufacturer/supplier is foisting off on the consumer a glass that is 1 " my fugitive: I think the book My Fugitive was all about david Jannsen's wife. She wrote more about herself than David Janssen..Plus I found a lot of mistakes in it.....Someone else like Dani Jannsen should write a book..." not worth it: This definitely isn't worth the money. Some little things, like wrong captions on pictures and other stuff. The book was more about Ellie Janssen, with a lot of name dropping, than David."" Contains negligent misleading information: I bought an earlier edition of this book, along with Hiking Wyoming by the same publisher.I didn't get to either of those states yet to try out any of the hikes but I did notice that both books contain the identical information about bears -they don't distinguish between black and grizzly bears and the advice they give is TOTALLY WRONG for black bears and likely to get someone killed!They clearly didn't do their research properly (if at all) in this case - I hope the rest of the book is better quality!"" Waste of Money: If you are collecting coins to spend later, this is for you. If you are collecting coins to sell later you're better off using coin flips. The coin flips protect the coin from toning which can decrease the value of your precious collection.I say don't buy it unless you are gonna spend the collection."" Great Find: Love this exercise book. Austin clearly outlines the program, which is easy to follow and effective. With a variety of exercise options, the program allows you to choose what's best and easiest for you, regardless of time constraints. I especially like that Austin is a little older so is aware of the needs of women ""of a certain age."""" Photo instructions are bad: I have been doing intermediate Pilates for about 18 months now. I saw this book in a store and was curious about it, so I picked it up and started flipping through it. I was shocked to see that in each photo, Denise has her head turned, grinning at the camera instead of actually putting her head in the proper position for the move. Head position is essential to all the moves, and I don't know very many that involve turning one's head to one side and smiling widely! LOL Anyway, to be fair once I saw that I didn't read any of the book. Maybe she makes up for it in the written descriptions. But that photo faux pas was enough to make me put down the book and not look back. I can't believe some editor let that book get published that way! It could be a great book for all I know, but just those photos were enough to make me cringe!"" FAKE CD: Not only is this CD a very low-quality bootleg, it has several songs on here t.A.T.u never even SANG. The translations in the titles are atrocious, which ought to tip off even impulsive buyers. Not worth one red cent."" WHY?!!: any book that is written, be it a novel or something else is written for a reason. the reason can be either to satisfy an artistic impulse or to let people know something .. i mean to impart knowledge or just plainly commercial. however this novel does not fall into any of these categories. it would be surprising if the author thought that this novel would earn money, as i am sure it wont. it doesnt impart any knowledge, and of course it does not satisf any artistic impulse. so why did he write it?well that is the million dollar question!! similar to why i am writing this review?! i guess i have a better reason than lidwell in the sense i am imparting knowledge to the innocent reader who might be tempted by the blurb of the book into thinking that it would be a satidfying read..hell! NO! it isnt..and well readers beware before venturing to buy or even borrow or even for that matter steal this book.."" Very Disappointed: Once again i went for this Jig just because of the price, and it's basic function. I was wrong. When i came home to test the jig i could not believe the metal shavings that came out of the jig hole. The when i pulled my wood out of the jig the pilot holes were a mess. I only reccomend this tool for those who like to play around with hobby projects. If you an intermediate to expert woodworker then stay away. The is a reason why the good tools cost more. Go look at the Kreg pocket hole system first.."" Disappointing: Bought this jig to save money. The first pocket hole was great. The next dozen or so were awful. And yes, with every drill (despite following the directions about taking it slow and withdrawing periodically)lots of metal shavings fell out. Ultimately, the jig was useless."" Cuts down on time!: This little jig has been great! we had to go out and buy an extension for our screwdriver to screw in the screws, but this little baby has been a lifesaver!!!"" Trys to be everything for everyone: I have over six years experience in SGML and wanted to find a book that would get me quickly to the nuts and bolts of XML. Aftyer reading the reviews here (yep I know, fatal mistake sometimes) I purchased this book and am disapointed. Too many ingredients in the soup I'm afraid. If you want a fat book that looks impressive on your shelf take mine. This book is trying to be an everything reference and fails."" jump into the deep blue....: Beautiful and exquisite filming, interesting facts - the slow motion high definition clips of the waves is mesmerizing. A great blu-ray dvd. If you dream about that tropical south seas island but can't get there as often as you would like - this does the trick." Life put into perspective: This was a fabulous book that makes one really appreciate the simplicity of daily life in America. This is an especially poignant book for mothers who must face life changing decisions. The writing was smooth and the book read well. I would highly recommend this to those who enjoy memoirs. Lee writes about the life of her grandmother and family members who live through some very difficult times. This one will stay on my shelf and I look forward to reading more of Lee's books." Impossible to Assemble: ... The directions are terrible. If you add the name plate, everthing else does not line up. The name plate is needed for stabalization, but it is impossible to connect the way it is designed. Right now it is on my basement floor in pieces - TOTALLY UNUSABLE!!!"" Beautiful and thoughtful: A visually exquisite film with an interesting story, excellent performances, lush soundtrack and an authentic look which make for a very enjoyable and satisfying viewing experience. However, since it was filmed in Panavision, I do wish it was offered in a widescreen edition, which would be even better."" talk talk talk ...: This movie is impossible to watch. It's embarassingly melodramatic, running at full volume, no doubt to hide its lack of structure. The characters are always making anachronistic historical points. Its obsession with royal issues would give even the british press a headache. But worst of all -- the incredibly pointless, endless and unpretty scenery shots. No, that's not the worst part -- I forgot the fact that these are the worst performances imaginable by these actors. I've never seen Anthony Hopkins this bad. Or Peter O'Toole so over-the-top. Or Katherine Hepburn so desperately asking herself ""how am I going to make this interesting?"" This pseudo-psycho-history holds up so badly and seems so unreal today, that it will be completely forgotten 20 years hence and good riddance. [Sappy] poetic obsessions with cartoon historical figures have seen their last days, I hope, I hope ..."" The best of its kind.: This is a movie for people who are interested in more than special effects and inane dialogue. Contrary to most, if not all, of what is spewed out of Hollywood these days to an increasingly undiscerning audience, this one requires some thought and attention. The dialogue, at times, demonstrates the heights to which prose can rise, and the situations are as real as any that the common person might face. Alienation from loved ones, striking out at those we love because they hurt us, failing to gain what we seek because we accept less than what we truely desire; in short, the common human experience. Yet it ends on a positive note, one that affirms that the deeds of the past may yet be swallowed by the possibilities to come. The acting is well done, and the characters well defined. It is a movie that stands apart, and one that will be remembered by all who demand quality in their entertainment." Royal Disfunctional Family: Exceptional performances of royal family intriques and betrayals. The double and triple crosses are both tragic and comedic. No one can be trusted. This is a drama borne upon words. It is an intelligent person's film. Not for those mezmerized by bloodletting and carnage action films." only alittle better: This is the best Chemical Brother album still to date. Surrender in my honest opinion just doesn't compare to this kinda of energy. Its only about 1% better than Exit planet dust though .. The two albums are very similar in every way, cept this is a tad longer and the Stand out tracks such as Block Rockn Beats and Setting sun are better than the best of Exit planet dust, being Song to the siren and Life is sweet again .. im my opinion.Chemical Brothers are getting alot of unnessisary Heat for being ""sell outs"" lately , Utter B.S., all morons who belive this should be made to suck on plastic bags."" the worst chemical brothers cd ever!!: This cd flat out sucks. First off, techno isn't supposed to have words, and second if you were going to have lyrics, why in god's name would you pick noel gahlager. He has the worst voice ever. I loved exit planet dust, but this can't even be labeled as techno, it's more like pop/rock. If you like oasis, and like pop/rock/techno/crap, then be my guest go get this album, if not, come on over to the side of people with good taste, and do yourself a favor by buyin any cd buy: Daft punk, underworld, fluke, juno reactor, the orb, orbital, autechre, etc.Don't waste your money, it sucks!!"" This CD is one of the trippiest things I've ever heard!: This CD is really wonderful. It just makes me want to dance. It has interesting and complex rhythms that make you really stop and listen. At some points it is intensely beautiful; at others, hideously ugly. I practically live and breathe this CD. I wake up and fall asleep to it."" Dissapointing: I was extremely dissapointed by this album. Many of the tracks are weak at best, and I can't name a single song that stands out from the rest.Instead, I suggest ""Exit Planet Dust"" or The Crystal Method's ""Vegas"" instead. This album, as far as I'm concerned, is simply not worth the money." Stylish Citronella Candle: Candle is just the right size for my lamp post container. It works very well in keeping insects away." Yes, piece of Junk indeed: My Razr started to play funny games on me. Seems like sometimes it refuses to charge my batteries...So I decided to buy something extra to charge the batteries without the phone...It worked once and then died... Apparently the power adapter died after about 24 hours...I tried another adapter and if it lights the unit, no charging is happening...I already disposed of the wrapping so I cannot even send it back... I lost 20$ plus shipping for this PIECE OF JUNK!Is it visible I am not happy at all?"" Very Entertaining!: As a preschool teacher, I'm always looking for good books that will keep the attention of my kids. Even though this book is a little lengthy for very small children, it really keeps their attention. The kids get a kick out of the fact that a doughnut has an opinion whether he should be eaten or not. They also really loved the ending. I have already recommended this book to family, friends, and other teachers. Very cute!"" Gundam Wing Rules!: Gundam Wing is definately the coolest show I've ever seen, anime or otherwise. The plot is really cool and the machines are so awesome. Gundam Deathscythe kicks! All the characters are really cool and you find out more about them as you go along. Go Gundam Boys! (Quatre has cool hair.)"" Gundam Series: The Gundam Wing series is probably the best of all the Mobile Suit Gundam series, that originated back in 1979. The series is based around giant mecha(mobile suits), and the five gundam pilots who are trying to defeat the political organization OZ, run by Tres Kushrenada. Over time eras change and the plot becomes more involved. Though the show might not be appropriate for children under about 7 or 9 yrs old, it is a complex, deep political series with a lot of twists and turns in the plot. For any anime fan, this is a must see, especcially if you enjoy action that never ceases. It deals a lot with morals and death, connected with mobile suits and guns and stuff. For more information on Gundam Wing and more anime, check out my site [sakurasplace]." the beginning of a new era: this is the first four episodes of the gundam wing series. it is an absolute must if you wish to understand following episodes as well as the very last episode. this video shows how it all begins. the military operation and the beginning war with the colonies versus earth. 5 gundam pilots arrive to earth to fight for the colonies. you get to see all 5 gundams in battle. a definate good starter for your collection." Gundam WIng is a sellout of the original spirit of Gundam!: I think anypone who has seen the original and the Z,ZZ and Char's COunterattack will agree that Gundam WIng is a sellout of the original spirit of what makes Gundam so great. Gundam Wing is more the flair of Power Rangers -- invincible, color-schemed, good looking young men who are basically one dimensional characters. Gundam Wing may have been good nuff as a standalone series, but it really shoudlnt be included as a Gundam series. That is just wrong. It does injustice to the rest of the Gundam saga. If you want real GUndam, see 0083 Stardust memory or 8th Platoon. NOW THOSE ARE WHAT GUNDAMS ARE ALL ABOUT!!"" Certainly not for professional developers!: After reading through this book, I was not sure if this book is focused on Java programming or XML or Servlets and JSP programming, although it claims to be about how to integrate all these technologies together. The book overall is not very well organized and it is tough sometimes to really make out what the authors are trying to convey. As for the example code, it is not difficult to make out that the authors are from academia and certainly are not developers who hack it out in the real world."" Good Points of View: Good points of view, but not all-encompassing analysis. Not militantly feminist, but focuses on a woman's perspective. A nice companion to the commentary one normally finds." i wish i could rate this lower: this is a horrible cd. fat boy slim has for a long time corrupted our music with his mainstream whorthless crap and ive had enough. i sat buy idly until he remixed smells like teen spirit. he ruined a perfect song and runed it into a worthless funk song. i think the populace should boycote his junk to purge the airways of tthis low level crap." Better ones out there: This magnifying glass is cheap and plasticky. It does work but there're better ones out there for the same price. I saw one the same size with better construction, 6 led's instead of 1, and cheaper too at my local Ace store."" A thinking woman's guide to relationships: The title of this book is completely misleading - it gives the impression that it is about how women should behave to ""get"" a man. There is a bit of disucssion regarding female behavioral attributes that can turn a man away, but for the most part, it's a great overall read on the underpinnings of relationships that would be valuable to both sexes. It discusses the bonding process, how men and women bond differently and how those differences create opposite behaviors in men and women, the stages of relationships and how both partners react to the stages, etc... It's a quick read that helped me think of relationships more objectively and more realistically."" GREAT book!!: I have bought a lot of books here but even if i have liked it i never wrote a review, but this one sure deserves it a lot! There're a bunch of books that talks about the subject of man and women differences, the things men do, what women should ""do"", what the heck someone did wrong, and are so popular but at the same time superfluous... this one won't tell you what ""to do"" or ""act"" like the so called ""bitch"" but it will sure explain lots of things you (and i) had never realized; it's complete, smart, professional, accurate, and for sure will be one of those books you will reread again, and change the way you see you relationship, because of the great approach! I highly recommended if you want to have a valuable book this absolutely is it(and why not ""Smart Women/Foolish Choices"" great book as well!). Hope it helps you to overcome some of your doubts and erase some of the myths..." 50% polyester Peformance Cotton?: These are listed as 100% cotton in the description but the graphite and grey heather colors are 50% and 52% polyester respectively. Much too thin: These pants were so thin my husband refused to try them on and returned them. Held up to the light they were see-thru." comfortable but sized for short legged people: Bought a whole bunch of these in black, grey, and blue. Loved the open leg, light material. HOWEVER, they are imports, and they must be produced in a country of midgets. They are over-generously proportioned in the legs and seat, but a medium pant ought to have a leg inseam in the 32"" in range. These are about 28"" after the first washing -52%poly/42%cotton. Steve Urkle would be proud to wear them, but I'll be turning them into shorts - heck they're already knickers. Additionally, Russell has no customer service to speak of. Their web site listed outdated phone numbers. An email to their sales rep, and a phone call to an answering machine at the corporate office for the Southern Division (since the northeast's numbers were non-functional) resulted in no response. I always had good luck with their product, but I wouldn't buy from them again after this."" Outstanding! Non lawyers can learn a lot: A previous 'reviewer' from Silver Srping must not have read the same book I did. (Or maybe they didn't read the book?)Keith Evans states very clearly in his book that his rules will *seem* like common sense *after* you read them. And they do.But that is the brilliance of Common Sense Rules of Advocacy: the author makes learning these rules effortless, like you knew them all along. Even though you didn't.The testimonials in the first review by the publisher and the other reviews on the book's web site are right on. This is a valuable and easy to read book that anyone who must persuade others will benefit from reading.Well worth the price of admission." Boring and repetitious: It seems that this song has been heard before many times./ A lot of what appears here is haphazard and re-cycled." The ultimate cure for insomnia: 1. I think a lot of folks confuse a movie review with a review of history... As an american with no ties to either Turkey or Armenia, I have no bias either way in regards to the history as depicted in this film.2. With the above being said, this is simply a completely boring movie. Furthermore, the acting is lame (stiff and unnatural), the characters are just too... too disjointed in regards to the story as a whole and the writing; man the writing is just completely boring. Thus, please avoid this dud and for those who want to enlighten the world in regards to Armenian history, please find someone who can actually create a worthwhile movie."" Excellent book to learn JSP !: Believe me. If you know only HTML and want to learn JSP, this is the only book you need!This book covers variety of topics like: Object-oriented programming in Java, Java's core utility and input/output classes, How to use and create JSP Tag Libraries, Best practices in designing web applications with Java, How to install Java and JSP/Servlets, How to create dynamic web sites with JavaServer Pages (JSP), Relational database access with MySQL and JDBC, Using the popular Struts framework to simplify application design" The Trail of Seven days: I made the title to my review of the Trail to Seven Pines the Trail of seven days because thats how long it takes to get to the climax of the story. Other than having the longest rising action I have ever read I would say this is a very good book to read. You will really enjoy this book if you like westerns with alot of action. This book is full of action so that way you won't get bored while your reading it. So all in all if you want a good book to read The Trail to Seven Pines is definintly the way to go." Still Funny!: For fans of early British humor and pre-Monty Python, this is worth including in your collection, even though the quality of the recording is not the best. With his college friends, my husband saw a production in Chicago during the ""Fringe"" American tour. Several sketches he saw in the original show are not on this recording, and he misses those. But this brings back fond memories, and many laughs, of that live performance."" PNY Does Not Honor Their Rebates!: PNY is purposely avoiding fulfilling rebate requests! I bought several memory modules during the rebate period. The rebate specifically states that there is (was) no limit as to number of items being purchased and rebated. This was earlier this Fall (late Summer), and to date, I have only received one $30 rebate check. And I submitted a rebate request for a total of 8 memory units. PNY still owes me $210.00! If you're hoping for a rebate associated with this product, don't hold your breath! They won't return any e-mail inquiries, and they leave their phone(s) off-hook at their ""Rebate Hotline."" PNY Does NOT care about it's customers!"" A solid cable for home use: As far as I can tell, this is a well made cable. It hasn't been road tested (by me) so I can't comment on its durability in that arena. It's cool looks complement the other colorful cables in my rig for quick identification."" Kirk Franklin and the Family: Live: Kirk Franklin and the Family : Live is an excellent gospel DVD , from start to finish they kept the spirit high and their energy flowing.I would recommand this DVD for others to purchase. I "" THANK"" Kirk for also captivating the attention of our younger generation and bringing them closer to god's words thru his musics. The sound and lights were very sharp in giving this DVD very high quality." Great Glasses: I love these Bodum double wall glasses. I drink beer from them often. We also have the Bodum double wall coffee mugs. My wife and I have coffee in them every day. The beer glasses keep the beer colder than any other glass and the coffee mugs keep coffee hotter than any mug except a stainless steel mug with a top on it. The bodum glassware is much nicer to drink from when you're sitting relaxing.Be very careful with them though.I've had the beer glasses for 3 1/2 " Too fragile: I read the review about how easily these glasses crack, but I bought anyway. Sure enough, after first use, one is cracked."" bad quality: this mouthpiece is very bad quality,you cannot hold out a steady note with this and is pretty hard to play.my old one is doesn't even have a brand and is much better.all the products i bought from Rico sucks and i will not be buying from them again.fortunately i was able to get a refund." Very helpful!: Nice book for anyone who is starting off or just wants to learn how hats are made! Easy to follow!" Beautifully written!: This book should be read be everyone. Lozada tells not only the story of one little boy, but the story of the world we live in today. Get it and read it."" This album is excellent, but....: ...ive heard so much better techno. Ive heard better Ambient Techno. I would have given 3 stars, but I feel I will appreciate it a bit more, sometime in the future.For now, all I hear are irritating, mindless sounds in some of the tracks. ""We have explosive"", for example, uses so much computer sound, that it becomes unmanageable. The sounds are so silly, they seem like something from a children's cartoon. Isn't this supposed to simulate a ""real"" armaggedeon environment?Most of the tracks are hauntingly beautiful. These are the pillars that hold up this record. ""My Kingdom"" is one of the best tracks Ive ever heard. Some of the other tracks are noisy, but also listenable. They take ambient music to a whole new level. Some tracks though, either seem like fillers, because thay take a good 1-2 "" Boring: Lacks musical composing skills. Rely on too much sampled sounds. Not enough breaks to give a sense of space. The concept is there, but the computer seems to dominate the human brain. Very boring because it's lacking substances than can create so much potential. It's a scary future after all."" Poor packaging...: I paid $39 for this with free shipping from amazon and I expected a cheap looking table as most the reviews mentioned. What I didn't expect was the piss poor packaging that allowed the finished panels to slide within the box leaving then completely scratched. If not scratched this would be a nice table.I use this as a printer table that is kind of out-of-sight, so, for the 40 bucks even a scratched table is useful and not worth returning and re assembling a new one. Plus, seeing this was a manufactures box I assume they are all packed the same."" dont buy: I just go this thing in the mail and assembled it, defintely not worth the money. This thing should be sold for 5 dollars, its really flimbsy and cheap. The color is very lighter and different than the picture shown and a couple of the screw holes were missing. also the $22 "" Cheap.: I expected this to be a better quality product. It shipped well, and the packaging was good. But the product itself was disappointing.The wood is a cheap pine, and only the front, rear and top are actually wood. The sides and shelves are like a laminated cardboard. The pre-drilled holes weren't exactly lined up, so the sides didn't quite fit right and the pins that hold up the inside shelf didn't fit into the pre-drilled pin hole, so I had to bang them in with a hammer. The bottom shelf doesn't have notches to make it fit properly, and so it's not flat.Once I had it completely together, the misaligned holes mean that it doesn't sit right and one of the legs is about 1/2"" shorter on one side, so it wobbles. Had to cram a wedge under that one leg.I should have gone to IKEA."" Not happy: We got these as a gift and they were supposed to be a Natural Oak finish, they aren't they are very light. They are only partially wood, the rest is particle board. They are cheap and they look cheap."" Poor quality, poor description, poor return policy: The product description wasn't clear on whether feet were contained, but ""products frequently purchased with"" included the feet. I should have called but went ahead and ordered the extra feet. The panel does include feet, unfortunately neither set attached as directions show. I'm really disappointed with the poor quality of product HON is selling currently. When I called about returns, shipping at my expense would cost 50% of my refund."" NOT for learning Java!: If you're looking to break into Java programming using your Mac, this is definately NOT the book to choose! This book is basically a single-source for all the miscellaneous docs, FAQs, and ""how would I"" type info that can already be found in Apple docs if you're willing to look for it. Book covers in brief topics such as using the various Java tools for packaging Java apps, what editors are available for the Mac, a short description of the various Mac interfaces, etc. This book is for experienced Java programmers who are interested in packaging their apps for OS X... assumes a great deal of knowledge and experience with Java."" No longer being manufactured: My daughter loves these cereal bars. After waiting months for them to be back in stock either here, my local store or any other website, I emailed General Mills. They confirmed that the Cocoa Puffs bars are no longer being made. :-("" Classic Doomsday Thriller: Nuclear explosions cause the earth's axis to tilt and start moving towards the sun. Naturally things heat up causing Mother Nature to wreck havoc on earth and it's inhabitants. This film is intelligently written, well acted, fast paced and frightening which is what every classic sci-fi movie should be. I have been wanting to see this movie for years but could never find it. Now it has a beautiful widescreen picture and my life is closer to being complete. Unfortunately , the sound leaves something to be desired. You can still hear the dialoge but it is a mirco second out of sync making it looked dubbed. If not for this problem (it could just be my copy) the DVD would have gotten 5 stars."" Great movie bad region: I wanted to buy a DVD copy of this very good science fiction movie. Unfortunately, They sent me a region 2 " UNHAPPY: Sorry to say this unit I bought from Fry's is not good. The water pump has a rubber piece inside that will only last about 3 months of use before it gets a hole in it and spews water all over the floor. I am on my third rubber piece. Easy to replace be if you have hardwood floors as I do put the unit in a plastic tray or you will be sorry. I will not buy another. The company needs to improve the water pump. So I kept It......: Dissatisfied! Only 1-2  depressing!: I only got through a few pages when I knew this book was just not for me. The first reviewer liked it - but called it dark. It's more like deadly dull than dark. Depressing. I'd give it a D!I really hoped this would be an entertaining read." Na mean: I dont know if wu authorised this cd,[...]. I think this a very respectable collection of soul songs. Tracks like ""motherless child"" and ""you outa be with me"" are very deep and heavy. You would never here stuff like this come out today."" My Favorite No-Calorie Guilty Pleasure!: Seriously, when I find copies of this book, I buy them and send them to friends as ""de-stressing"" gifts with instructions on usage: 1 "" Purchase Regrets: The subtitles were often very difficult to read (white letters on white background etc) and sometimes flashed on screen to quickly to read. It was too long and boring at times. Had I known that the movie had subttiles I wouldn't have purchased it. I read many reviews but none of them mentioned subtitles. Now for the movie, the storyline is not bad but not that great either. I definitely would not recommend this movie."" Not in English: The product description says this movie is in English and Spanish. Not so. It is in Spanish, with English subtitles. Not the same thing. If you are fluent in Spanish, or don't mind reading subtitles while trying to watch the picture, go ahead an get it. Otherwise, save your money for something else."" Pretty good: This movie is very interesting. However, the director had reached perfection with his ""Lovers of the Artic Circle"", and ""Sex and Lucia"" is no way as wonderful and magical as the former. Anyway I recommend this film to everyone who's looking for something different. Enjoy it! Bye." Not for me: I enjoy good work but can not appreciate this movie. First of all most of the dialog is in Spanish but subtitles are available. Many sceens are an attempt at good artful shooting but begin to not make scence as to what is going on. The story does not flow well and is difficult to understand - maybe because I do not converse in Spansih. So does the sex scenes make up for it to qualify for a good erotic movie. NO - If you are looking for something to stimulate you and your concenting adult partner - this is not it unless she can translate for you." Ling Ling - Diana - you are remarkable!: I dare you to put down this book before finishing it!You can throw away your self-help books and just read the last chapter of Diana's book over and over.Each chapter has brief ""lessons"" that are worth saving, too.I'm an Irish Christian woman and was skeptical because I don't know much about China; but this lady has a beautiful soul and so much to offer!I thank Warran Whitlock for sharing this book, and the valuable Joint Venture products that were included with the modest price.Honesty, intelligence, cooperation, barter, friendship, joint ventures... Diana teaches us to think positive and big.My deepest gratitude for a book well-written!Ling Ling, you are Beautiful!!!!!LoveMary" A self-serving memoir and travelog: Don't buy this book... It contains delusional ramblings and resentments that insult the memory of the one who made Al Martinez a success. Easy to install!: Easy to install and a great price! Seems to be built pretty solid. The black looks good too. Would buy again. A+" Not good at all: First of all, the book is very poorly written. The grammar, sentence structure are barely tolerable and makes the reading frustating to say the least. Second, this book is written by 5 different authors. AND IT SHOWS. In terms of content organization I would give the book a zero star. Third, most of the material covered is also found in the php online manual. Why would you want to look up a function in a book that has a terrible index when you can do a search/find on the online pdf manual?Fourth, the examples covered in the book have very little explanation to it. Fifth, too expensive." Best PHP book I have found: This book was just what I was looking for to launch a new dynamic website I am building. Clear concise writing and good examples make this book an invaluable reference. Disjointed [stuff]: This book is 1300 pages of [stuff]. Its written by about 10 people who obviously didn't look at each others segments because they repeat the same stuff over and over. If they took out all the information that was repeated throughout the book it would be about 300 pages. I was better served by the MSDN documentation. Wrox used to have a good reputation for solid books but it seems like quantity over quality is what they are after." Totally Useless Book: I am still wondering why I brought this book?? I am an experienced programmer and I have been working in ASP & other related technologies for the last 3 years. This book is the most pathetic book I have ever read. There are incomplete examples scattered through out the book and no head or tail can be made out of them. If anybody of you is from India, then forget to access the online edition of the book which has been advertised on the cover page."" Comfortable & worth every penny: I was looking for a cow boots & I found it here in Amazon...Got one for myself & a friend & we both loved it. Everybody make fuss about it how it looks great, I just hope that the eyes moved...I will buy another pair again." Moo!!!: Recieved these boots in 3 days. Absolutely love them. They are so-o cute. I hike with my dog in the woods and he happens to be a black and white border collie so we are stylin!! They are comfy. I bought them for working in the garden and I'm more than satisfied!! Doesn't smell like other Mustela products: the smell is very strong and it doesn't smell like the other mustela products. I never used this on my daughter. Great for beginning!: I found this book very useful just like any other Wrox book. It has everything one needs to start learning .Net database applications. I have not tried the code but the explanations are helpful. The thing I like the most was list of sequential steps needed to perform a task before any example. It really breaks down the whole exercise into some meaningful steps and helps one follow the example clearly." This version is now outdated: This version of the nutshell book is outdated. Look on Amazon for the more recent version, currently 2008:First Amendment in a Nutshell (Nutshell Series)"" Buy This Bag Somewhere Else: With so many ""free shipping,"" even ""free shipping and free returns"" offers out there, don't make the same mistake I did by buying from Luggage Warehouse. Not only does the Luggage Warehouse make the customer pay shipping both ways; they even charge an additional $5 if you're unhappy with the product and want to return it. (To be fair, their $5 restocking fee policy is in the fine print, but I missed it. The ""customer service""--ha--representative just told me I should feel bad for them, not the other way around, because they have to pay fees to sell their merchandise on Amazon and now, thanks to me, they're going to lose money on this purchase.)"" Where did the guy learn to write?: Having practiced digital logic design in its many forms (from basic digital implementations to VHDL), over a period of 20+ years, I must state that this is possibly the most poorly written text I have ever seen on the discipline." Dark but brilliant: 3 girls who are rejected by their families are sent to The Magdeline Sisters to clean up their tawdry lives and find out that the Sisters aren't as holy as they would appear." The Magdalene Sisters: This absorbing film follows the fate of several teen girls who are de facto inmates in a 1960s convent for wayward girls. Basing his script on actual reformatories run in the 1960s by the Irish Catholic Church, Scottish actor-director Mullan clearly has an investment in the subject matter, injecting a gripping sense of urgency that sets ""Girls"" apart from other social-issue films. Striking performances from all four lead actors and Mullan's careful, sympathetic attention to the daily strife that affects these young girls may not leaven the dour tone, but they do give his harrowing drama a sense of outraged humanitarianism. Hard to forget."" Rudimentary instruction: I bought this book because I was looking for instructions on brush calligraphy and lettering. I practically found none (there are only two pages devoted to the subject with very little information, no drills, no exercises.) The section on pen calligraphy is very basic, too. I would only recommend this book to absolute beginners, or maybe not even to them. There are plenty of copyright-free books about penmanship online." Great Product!: PetSafe Training Systems Probe PackVery happy with this item! Has an ample amount of different size probes so you can use for any type dog as needed. Great price too!" Once you've seen them live...: You might not like this album, but as a whole Infusion is a forward thinking, innovative, FUN group of electronic music makers. Alas, once you have seen them live (as ALL of it - including vocals is live) it's hard to listen to them in your car. All in all a good show of some easy listening rock-tronicaMaybe their next album will really be inspired!"" Mengelberg serves up Beethoven and Schubert.: The great Dutch conductor Willem Mengelberg would often justify his so-called ""changements"" to Beethoven scores by saying, ""Don't argue with me - I am the best pupil of the best pupil of Beethoven"". There are very few ""changements"" evident in these famous recordings, so well presented in this Naxos issue. A figure that occurs for the first time in the ""Coriolan"" Overture at about one minute in is always stretched out for an extra beat whenever it occurs. The ""Turkish March"" is played through twice, as it was in an earlier recording by the same forces made in 1930. Otherwise everything is as the composers indicated in their scores, and performed and recorded in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw probably with more precision, excitement and impact than they ever dreamed possible."" Beginning Java Web Services: The book itself is excellent, with all manner of examples and descriptions. However, the publishers let them down. If you go to the Wrox site (www.wrox.com) as of today (27th October 2004), you will not find any reference to the book anywhere on their site. Not even when you try to search for the book by ISBN number; as such all the examples provided with the book are unavailable for download." Nice first combo for the kids: We ordered 2 " Inaccurate: I reviewed material relating to the Swartwout-Hoyt scandal and found it full of errors. The book says Swartwout stole $2.25 million, but the audit showed $1.25 million, and later studies have shown that it was less than $400,000. The defalcation surfaced in 1838, not 1841. The bibliography proves the 1841 "" Watch Out What You Think: Blackwood explores the concept that the afterlife for each person is what they believe it will be. This book deals with the rising horror faced by the widow of a fanatically religious man who has twisted the christian religion to psychologically abuse and enslave his wife. Although the man has died, his belief structure lingers.The book is not an attack on God, but it is an open attack on the ways in which religion and the concept of God is often twisted by individuals to achieve power. If you think of the Spanish Inquisition, the Salem Witch Trials, the Nazis, Jim Jones, Charles Manson and the other modern cults, and the September 11th bombings you realize that this is a struggle happening all over the world every day.As you read of this one women's struggle and think that it is just one of many homes in which the struggle is ongoing, one cannot help but feel the chills."" Genuine ,: I can't beleive I waited this long to write this review. Ms Crystal herself sent me a Personalize copy of her work via my book club coast2coast.com. I'm a survivor of Hurricane Katrina and I were on a readers block. Crystal's book start kinda slow for me I put it down for about 2 "" Heard the buzz...: I've heard the buzz about Hood Rich for awhile now. My friend, author Kerry E. Wagner recently recommended that I check out this great talent, Crystal Perkins-Stell. I know what the buzz is about now."" Solid examples, lots of details, inside scoop: This is a an excellent primer/reference on Biztalk Server 2000 for developers new/old to B2B and EAI. The examples they use in the book are consistent and realistic; the explanations clear and thorough.One of the things I liked the most about this book is that the authors were not afraid to pop the hood open and show you the gory guts of the engine inside (i.e. their section on writing your own functoids is very cool, as well as routing, custom parsing and serializing).If you already know Biztalk and have worked with it since it was in beta (like I have), you'll still find lots of valuable nuggets of information and ""here's why they did it this way"" explanations.enjoy it, I sure did.-jason chahin, co-author ""COM/DCOM Unleashed"""" Not the book you want if you are new to industry: This book is not written in a clear and concise manner for me. You may be better in getting, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology, 5E"" Park Beat: This book has vivid, exciting, colorful illustrations and wonderful langauge. As an inner city elementary school reading specialist, I look for engaging books with a creative use of language. This book has rhythm and rhyme that may inspire many children to try to emulate the style and write their own book. Also, the language is rich and lends itself to a study of synonyms and words that appeal to all five senses. I took it out of the library and now I am adding it to my own."" Not Compatible!: This card is not compatible with the HP Pavillion 6330. Despite the cliams of PC compatibility it did not work for me - my computer never recognized it. I went to the PNY site and found out that other products are correct, you might want to do the same before you buy this." Edu Majors: this book was a great vaule from the amazon market. if your studying for your cst exam pick this up its a easy read and will help No page numbers: This book is for my credential program. Couldn't get a hard copy fast enough so bought this. It sure was quick but it doesn't have any PAGE NUMBERS. How can you site a reference from this text if you can't find the page number. Location is completely irrelevant." Where's Waldo? Where's the book?: The book is a tiny version, which wasn't explicitly stated in the description. Otherwise, it is nice, new. No wonder it was so inexpensive, cuz, it is tiny."" Gotta Know When to Hold 'em: We've got two of these in our large Vision cage for the parakeets. The holder is attached to the cage by slipping two metal hooks over a horizontal bar. Since the holder does seem to move at times, we hold it stationary with a supplementary stationery clip.The attached perch at the bottom of the holder is an added bonus, giving the birds another option and approach for eating the cuttle bone. I'm looking at the cage while writing this and imagining how well this holder would do with a spray of millet also. It seems like it would hold the millet in place nicely and allow the bird full access to this, their favorite treat.The cuttle bone holder keeps the cuttle bone firmly in place. None have fallen off even under the most robust of beak attacks."" Amazing insight: As a 9-year recovering anorexic, I searched for years for the reason I felt like I needed to starve myself. Although I think it is possible that anorexia does not have one single reason behind it, this book explained for me personally why I have struggled for so long. Peggy Claude-Pierre shows exceptional sensitivity and insight into the life-threateneding disorder of anorexia. For me she provided the answers I needed to enter permanence and complete recovery. This book is a definite must-read for long-term sufferers of anorexia or bulimia. There is hope!"" Really Good!: Well this cd overall is pretty darn good. First of all the Vocals are awesome and ""Clock is Down"" is one of the best songs I've heard! But theres somthing I just cant put my finger on that keeps them from 5 stars...anyway if your into emo you might wanna try it out."" Another Fallen Emo Soldier!!!!: This is in my personal opinion, the best Emo/Punk release of 2004. Every song is amazing. It's such a shame that they broke up before we got to hear a follow-up. The songs are very deep in lyrical nature, mostly dealing with christian views..(But don't let that turn you away)...there is a lot more to Letterkills than that. This record is a must for fans of Taking Back Sunday, Thrice, The Used, Thursday...stuff like that. It mixes modern Emo creativity with an almost Ac/Dc vibe at times, Producer Jim Wirt (Incubus, Hoobastank) brings out the best in these guys, helping them to create a record that will hopefully live on, even though they didn't.BEST SONGS:""Clock Is Down""""Time Marches On""""Carry You"" and""Hold My Heart (Part Two)"""" One of the best books of film criticism I've ever read: A paradigm of intelligent film criticism. Kolker's astute and subtle formal analysis of the films puts many other so-called critics to shame, and his discussions of the political implications of cinematic form and style are excellent. It is a serious book about movies, and his arguments and insights need to be thought about and struggled with- they are not a meant to be easily digested."" I really wanted to like this movie!: This movie is BAD, just plain bad. I watched the whole movie hoping to get something out of it, but there is nothing there. Watch it if you MUST but i am warning you it is awful. No entertainment value here. Just a little piece of cinema history i suppose?" Shawn Colvin - Polaroids - Video: My only disappointment is that she doesn't perform the song Polaroids. It is interesting to hear her comments about her videos." Saved a ton of money!: I bought this for a US history class that required I buy 3 different books (all included in this one-volume-edition) I saved hundreds because there is a new edition. I could not notice a difference, it was never an issue. My thought was that if it ever became an issue I was only out a few dollars... Food for thought, the textbook industry is a sham."" It truly works: Before I listened to ""Relax, Release and Dream On"", I had serious problems every night falling asleep. Typically I would toss and turn for 2-3 hours. In the morning, I was exhausted. Now that I'm listening to Gale's CD, I fall asleep almost immediately and sleep through the night. If I ever awaken, I just put her CD back on and immediately return to a peaceful sleep. Nothing else had ever helped me like this CD.David Emery Chicago" A waste of time ...: I bought this book at the airport returning from a long visit to the Netherlands and found the writing poor and mean-spirited. Look elsewhere if you want a current view of life in the Netherlands." Offensive and mean spirited: I have travelled throughout Holland, and have long loved the unique quality of the people. While this book makes some true statements, and is occassionally funny, it is predominantely derogatory and blindered.Many of the negative observations of the Dutch (and almost all of the observations are negative) are not even dutch specific. Living in the United States, I have seen many of the same flaws made manifest.Don't waste your money and risk having yourself tainted prior to a visit to Holland."" Fun and Oh So True!: I was born in Holland and lived there until I was 8. I find the Undutchables to be both hilarious and accurate in many ways. There is some exaggeration but, hey, the Dutch are special! I recommend this book many times over!" easy read: i love stuart woods novels. always keeps you interested. i like that there is more than one plot lines in his books. Great for schoolwork: I was able to work all day without being distracted today and I couldn't figure out what was different than my usual distracted day. Then I remembered that I took 2  Great Mirror: I first saw this mirror in a Hyatt hotel and had to have one at home. I purchased this one and it is perfect. Great magnification and it looks great too." Great idea, poor implementation: I love the idea of pump sprays for cooking oil. Most commercial sprays use some sort of propellant, and I don't want the propellant on either my food or my pans. I have bought two different varieties of pump sprays, with virtually identical results. Both of them worked fine, for one fill-up of oil. After refilling, both of the spray nozzles stopped misting and produced a stream of oil. I've tried cleaning the nozzles, but there seems to be no help. Save your money."" Works for me: I have had the Misto for about a month. After reading the reviews, I was a little hesitant to get one. However, I have used mine for a month and have had no problems. I do release the pressure by loosening the top after each use and I have been careful not to overfill it. It works great to mist food so spices stick for grilling. Besides, it is cheap enough that if it only lasts 6 months or a year, I'll just buy another."" Great Oil Mister: I received this item as a Christmas gift and I really like it. I put 1/3 of a cup of extra virgin olive oil in it, pumped it up and misted my salad. I use it to mist my frying pans and my George Forman. It works great. I like knowing what I'm spraying into my food and I know I'll save money not buying any more cooking sprays. Cons: Sometimes it takes more than one pump-up to spray a pan."" Doesn't work. Hard to impossible to clean: Creates a stream of oil rather than a spray. I found it impossible to completely clean the internal parts, causing the oil to eventually go rancid and ruin the sprayer." Beautiful book.: A beautiful book with great photos and ideas. There are instructions for a number of projects and an idea section in the back. Good for anyone who loves to look at photos of vintage items for inspiration." Junk?: Don't get me wrong, i'm a BIG BIG fan of Sonic Youth and the experimental one, not the grunge one of Dirty. My fav is Daydream Nation and NYC ghosts and flowers is great! I also very like all the other SYR relases...But, this one is a total weak one. It really sound like bad jams and forgotten tapes filled with ""clichÃ©s"" of the band weird sequences of noise. Nothing new is explored during the first tracks. The last track is not bad, but that's it. Go get SYR 2 "" Very Enjoyable selection.: 'The Girl with Orange Lips' sung by Dawn Upshaw, backed with a rather eclectic colleciton of musicians, is the kind of album Ms. Upshaw should really be doing. Like 'White Moon', it is a collection of unusual songs from far corners of 20th century repitoire, rather than an essay on the more familiar material which is done so well by the heavyweights such as Renee Fleming, Anne Sophie von Otter, and Cecilia Bartolli, not to mention songs of the modern European and American stage owned, in my mind, by Ute Lemper.Unlike another reviewer, I really prefer 'White Moon' to this album on a visceral level, although I listen to both at least once a year.My only criticism is that as original DVD releases go, it seems a bit short, but this only reinforces the fact that I would like to hear more of Ms. Upshaw do this material in a single shot."" I highly recommend this read.: Excellent book. The best thus far published by Bishop Clarence Harris. I highly recommend for those interested in using this as a resource in studying the word and looking at many different themes of the Bible including the Jewish apostolic roots of salvation, righteous living and preparation and the culmination of all things (""The End Times"")."" lame: I ordered this for an interactive instructional dvd in Spanish for my class to follow, but was very let down by a poor-quality recording and and outdoor space- not even in a studio! A waste of my money."" Curtain Up!: Tyne Daly's performance in ""Gypsy"" was Tony Award winning. She starred on Broadway as the ultimate stage momma 'Mama Rose'. On this album she proves she can sing and does quite well. We particularly enjoyed the songs ""Rose's Turn"", ""Together Where Ever We Go"" and ""Some People"". In ""Rose's Turn"" the ending of the song is very powerful. She did a great job and this lady can act the songs as well as sing them. My mom and I both own this disc and we've enjoyed it. We would really be happy to see her perform live in a play and she certainly should be doing more Broadway now. This album is worth the purchase if you're a Gypsy fan and/or Tyne Daly fan. I prefer this Gypsy and Ethel Merman's version to the newer ones. Great job and enjoyable album! It's a worthwhile purchase that I'm glad we made!"" Unappealing: To be honest, this voice sounds like a voice major's junior recital--and by that I don't mean the voice sounds fresh. It's incredibly limited in range and almost always harsh on the top. Frankly I'd rather hear Schubert sung by just about anyone else. For these songs skip this one and try Elly Ameling. DeGaetani's pianos and pianissimos are nice but it is hard to understand how she had a career with the instrument she possessed."" What a horrendous movie: I just wasted my 5 bucks on this horrendous dvd, the worst movie I ever watched. Terrible plot, terrible acting and terrible audio."" It was like reading a book about myself: This book helped me realize my negative behavior and take steps to begin healthly relationships, instead of addictive ones."" Where's the help??: I just finished reading this book, and actually it's outside waiting for the garbage truck to pick it up as I type this!Oh yes, the book told my story! The obsession about a guy in my life, but where's the help I need to 'fix it'?? It basically tells me I need to seek a professional to get over it?!? If I could afford a professional, I wouldn't have bought this book!I was SO into every story, thinking, THAT'S ME! Then I couldn't wait till the point where they told me how to work on this, but NOPE! It never came!So it get's one star from me. Actually, the star is for the person I bought it from through Amazon! They were great! :)"" I loved it: A book that displays Groucho as he was. If a true fan reads this, they should understand his unfortunate display of vulgarities related to the incedible childhood and subsequent amazing career paths of the brothers. In order to appreciate this book, you must read Harpo's account in ""Harpo Speaks"", as well as any thing by Adamson that you can."" Put your ears on: In a time where the majority of drum 'n bass beats sound Xeroxed, Photek's ""Modus"" is a breath of fresh air. The album's strong points are most definitely the thinking-man's rhythms, which are a staple in Photek's vocabulary, and the reason why his music as accepted by both raver kids and real drummers. Others have commented on how repetitive all the tracks are, but if one listen's closely, there are many subtle changes that occur, slight they may be, they are there."" OY, SUCH A PLEASURE!: Way back when some time just before my Bar Mitzvah it seemed like everyone and their Bubbe was listening to this album. Because of Connie Francis I learned the words to the songs my grandmother would sing me to sleep by. (..and believe me she was NO Connie Francis). In the mid 60s anything out there with the faintest trace of ""Yiddishkeit"" was considered a novelty. So when this hit the stands it seemed like the whole world, which for me existed within the confines of Northwest Baltimore, was listening to this album. What was most surprising to everyone was the simple fact that the words were pronounced perfectly as though Miss Francis had grown up speaking the language. I remember being disappointed to learn that she was in fact not Jewish at all but (as my grandmother put it) a ""Talenneh""! How wonderful that this recording was re-issued some time ago with one or two additions. And if you're just a Connie Francis fan, hey..you don't have to be Jewish!!"" Underrated movie: This is a lesser known John Garfield release. All of the acting skills that were evident in later John Garfield classics, were on display here, for the first time."" DISSAPOINTED: I WAS DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE,THE FORMAT WAS RECORDED IN SLP MODE, WHICH IS NOT THE BEST SOUND, & PICTURE PRODUCTION. BUT THE PRICE WAS EXTREMELY FAIR, WHICH IS WHY I DID NOT RETURN THE ITEM."" Show some respect: Of all the Hammer Dracula films I found this the best. Others perfer Horror of Dracula but that's more man hunt than horror movie. This movie captures the claustrophobic atmosphere that makes the first few chapters in the book so resonant.The acting as well is top notch. Christopher Lee doesn't speak, he hisses and it works. His manner and speech in the first movie contradicted the insane lust later on. This movie stays consistantly creepy. And the music is very powerful.I have two gripes. First the supplements on my dvd don't work, except for the awful commentary by the cast. It sounds like a theater full of noisy stuck up people who are talking about everything but the movie. I don't need to hear Christopher Lee repeating the question, ""What was I saying? while some great stuff is happening on screen. Commentary should support the film not drown it in nonsensical gossip. Anchor Bay and cast, have a little more repect for the work."" Great popcorn machine: Did quite a bit of research before buying and really happy with the result. The quantity of popcorn produced is good, its super easy to make and clean, and I believe the metal parts will last much longer than the plastic alternatives on most of the other inexpensive models."" Great Machine!: We love this machine. Bought it for our media room and the kids love it. Makes popcorn quickly and easily. Shipped and received in a timely manner, and fairly easy to assemble. Great experience."" Shame on Disney: I bought this set because my daughter so enjoyed her other video, ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" (which seems to be out of print now). I didn't realize that this set is essentially a repackaging of the same material from that video (1 "" Mystery fun for kids: Young Theodore Jones, called Jigsaw because of his love of solving puzzles and mysteries, (along with his friend Mila) is hired by his classmates to find out who the mystery author is who is scheduled to visit their school. Along the way they explore several meanings to the term ""ghostwriter""! My 7-yr old first-grader read this book to me. It is listed here for ages 4-8. It's a great book to read to this age group, but he stumbled a bit with some of the term and really didn't get into reading the story with pleasure 'til he was well into it. He is an advanced reader, but even so I think I'll save the other Jigsaw Jones books for me to read to him for another 6-12 "" Horrible book: This is one of the most terrible text books that I have ever used in a college class. To make matters worse, the material varies from edition to edition and even though the instructor told us to get the seventh addition, he is clearly using a test bank from an earlier or later edition where the information has changed. Aside from that obvious annoyance, the text is very vague in describing concepts and does a very poor job of making the reader actually understand the content. It is necessary to do research in order to understand the concepts fully and the information found through research always conflicts with the information given in the text." Good for people who start: A Person who just starts to learn something about Islamic culture should read it. For people who knows a lot the catalogue at the second part of the book would be helpful but it is also not complete." Great Pan: I bought this pan to use as protection for the spring form pan when making cheesecakes in a water bath. It was a tip from Cook's Illustrated and since wrapping the spring form pan in aluminum foil never kept the water out, I wanted to try it. It worked like a charm. I used a 9 inch spring form pan and we got a crispy crust on our cheesecake because no water got in."" Perfection in a book for designers!: This book is 100% more than I expected. Absolutely great for designers and artistswho wish to create beautiful headpieces.I have two hat books, ""From The Neck Up"" and ""Hats Design and Construction""(by the same author as this one) that rate up with this new one I just received. If you are a milliner, or want to learn to be..order all three of these books!I am a costume designer, both for myself as a Stevie Nicks Tribute artist, with White Winged Dove, and a seller of custom made finery, I love this book, and you will enjoy it, too...classy, well done, easy to follow, and inspiring!" Crappy Show: This show so lame it's not funny don't believe the hype about the finale it was so the dumb ross and rachel like come on ppl knew that was going to happen. this show is more like seeing everyone hooking up together then comedy and they have lame jokes not funny the best sitcom ever is EVERYBODY LOVE RAYMOND dysfunctional RULEZ" So Good, it's Scary...: I remember vividly my first encounter with this CD, I was in a band and (I happen to think at the time we were pretty good) we were all sitting around after a practice session going over ideas and the drummer (the infamous Dick ""O"") got every bodies attention and hushed us and hit the play button. Nobody spoke for easily 15 minutes (that's about 4 tracks into the CD) I was stunned to the point of silence, at that time in my life that was a rare occurrence. This is an unbelievable CD, crazily diverse at moments sappy and others brash and noisy but always very cool and masterfully played by all involved. If you are a musician running out of ideas or in a dry spell (I don't care what you play) this will save your life."" Take a chance and buy this.: I took a chance on buying this CD, as I only heard about it from a friend, and had heard no music from it. It ended up being truly one of the most worthwhile CD purchases I've made. My idea of music was so much more limited before this CD. I liked only a few of the tracks, and really didn't appreciate the grindcore tracks except for their over the top quality. But after a lot of listening it redefined music for me. It is truly refreshing and unlike anything I've heard. GREAT STEPPING STONE IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT! I highly recommend.-Chris"" OK: This DVD has some nice looking female models and very nice Impoted cars. There is no Nudity,the models are only in Bikini's and there is not much action to see. It is like going to a local car show down town.What you see is what you get.Don't waist your money on this DVD.I'am not impressed with it and feel that they could have done a better job at making it!"" Would work well, but doesn't work with Windows ME!!!: This product looks great for laptops like mine that only have USB ports, but it does not work with Windows ME!!! The drivers for the serial and parallel ports do not load.Only get this product if you have Windows 98/95 with USB." No better deal for the money!: The Oscar Schmidt OG1 " A Demonstration, Nothing More.: Unless you practice the system or forms presented in this video, you will not find it of use. This video contain almost no instruction or useful applications. As a practitioner of Chinese Swordsmanship I purchased it out of curiousity, I wish I had spent my money on something else... The Rock 'n' Roll presentation of the cutting sequenced just gave me a headache."" Why they can say natural?: It says natural, but it is NOT.After I use this product, I had terrible itch scalp a week. I never had problem any popular bland name hair color.Not recommended."" HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Relying on a glowing review from a famous talk show star's magazine, I decided to give this a try. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. This product turned my hair into a dry dull orange bush. Not only did it not provide shine, it did the polar opposite. Now I am growing out a rough orange mat of hair that was only made worse by trying to dye it natural black again with another product. I could not comb through my hair. It became fragile, wispy and prone to heavy duty breakage. Shine happy put a layer of dullness over my hair that lead to complete un-manageability. This product should be removed from the market."" brass free natural instincts: I agree with all the negative reviews. I used to love the medium brown brass free hair color. Once they changed the formula to be used on dry hair, instead of damp, my hair became a mess. It's extremely dry. It turns my grey hair yellow, and the refresher pack turned my hair orange/red. I'm now in search of a new brand. It's a shame that Natural Instincts changed a perfectly good product. I'm very disappointed."" Ving Rhames is the champ, Don King nothing but chump.: Don King is a self-promoter the likes that few have seen in our lifetime. This film takes a novel approach to telling the King story, blowing KING up into as big a buffoon as possible, and using King himself (actor Ving Rhames) in telling the tale. I give director John Herzfeld credit-it's a novel and appropriate approach to the biography of a man who truly is more caricature than real.Rhames gives an inspired and convincing performance as King, breathing much life into a film from a book that was for all practical purposes stillborn.Enjoy the movie for Rhames and pay little attention to the details."" Better than expected (and I always have high expectations for Bob's Red Mill products): Texture of the cooked product is simply wonderful. Despite the instructions on the back I double the cook time (to about 5 mins.) so it gets more creamy. This is an oat bran, so you shouldn't expect much flavor, but I usually add a tablespoon of maple syrup during cooking, throw some fruit on top afterwards and it is beyond good. Btw, I use milk to cook it in, not water. I only bought this a day ago, but I'm already loving it. Oh, and it's ridiculously cheap too (for what you get)."" Go-to breakfast food: I eat oat bran cereal almost every morning for breakfast. This was a great deal, and a convenient way to purchase it."" quaker alternative: giving this a try from regular quaker brand. so far so good. organic a plus. good quality, taste, texture. reputable brand. economical bulk buy."" Hauntingly ethereal sounds of heaven and hell on earth: The works of George Crumb are amazingly complex and require some work on the listener to comprehend the meaning and scope of the composition, Black Angels is a turbulent landscape, forever introducing variations and strict usage of extended technique in the electrified string ensemble... If you have never experienced George Crumbs music before, this album, and Ancient Voices of Children are MUST HAVES for a dynamic collection..."" The Mouse: Sensational, cute, and clever. Although intended for children, this book will delight children and adults alike. The story is suited perfectly for children and the art is simply captivating. I bought copies for my nieces and nephews and they now eagerly await the next Vincent Van Mouse. Don't pass this one up!!!! Oh, and by the way, a portion of the proceeds go to a very good cause."" Pan arrived broken: Ordered this product by mistake and decided to keep just in case I needed, but when I was going to use it cake pan was bended on the edge. I wouldnt have been a problem if it wasnt for the aluminum splinter i got on my finger. Returning this item. I bet they knew it was like that and sent it anyway. very dissapointed." EL PODER ESTA DENTRO DE TI: UN LIBRO MUY BUENO PARA LOS QUE EN SERIO ESTAMOS BUSCANDO UN CAMBIO EN NUESTRAS VIDAS. GRACIAS MIL LUISEE." The only Wilton product that has disappointed me thus far: I purchased this item hoping that it would make leveling and torting round cakes easier. The ""blade"" (a simple wire) does nothing to work through a sturdier or crusty cake, and in the process of trying to get it to do so, the cake gets damaged. I had nothing but problems with this item, and had to use my trusty bread knife to repair the damage from the leveler! I am back to using my knife to level and torte my cakes, and feel stupid for wasting the money on this item. My recommendation: stick with the tried and true method. It works perfectly every time."" Broke !: When I tried to open the tube to put the battery in, the clips that keep it together broke. Now every time I use it, I have to re- duct tape it together.Otherwise, it would have been a good light."" Thank you, I became certified: The book helped me preparing for the IBM certificate for XML (IBM certified solution developer - XML and related technologies), thank you..."" Why why why. . .: did they have to mess up a great thing. As the previous reviewers stated, this is NOT a CD version of the original. It's getting nearly impossible to find ""original"" vinyl recordings on CD anymore. ""They"" have to add bonus tracks, re-mix, etc, etc. Too bad that those that never had the opportunity to hear the originals will never experience how great they were (unless they can find a copy on vinyl)."" If you are looking for inspiration... Buy This Album: The best music will inspire as well as entertain you. Some music can change you; this album can.I am a religious sort and do not agree with most of Ian Anderson's lyrics. But they challenge me to justify what I do believe and keep me questioning the truth. The second half of this album will separate the pretenders from the faithful. If you only listen to people that agree with you, then you have surrendered your individuality.And if that wasn't enough, there is the music. Today's music is made up of new ""sounds"" that are good for one, maybe two, songs. Aqualung is not the one dimensional music we are accustomed to today. It will take you on an emotional roller coaster. That is a big reason for its continued success today. This album almost seems to change each time you listen to it."" Great album, but the sound...: The album was remastered from a copy of the British stereo master tape and is the worst example of NoNoise abuse I have ever heard. Try the Gold CD version on DCC to hear what the album really sounded like when it was first released on Island/Chrysalis in the early 70s (that was remastered without NoNoise and from the original master) The bonus tracks sounded better on the 20th anniversary box set." The worst purchaise I have ever made.: The btteries in the ophthalmoscope were rusty and old causing the whole inside of the equipment rusty and makes it disfunctional. This equipment shouldn't be sold as it is a damaged and useless pice. Genius: The only yoga book you really ever need. If you just studied this for the rest of your life surely you would be a master." great tool for a parent of a young child: This is an attractive and easy to use tool, and it makes an excellent size cookie for early elementary school students. Indispensable for those Valentine's day parties."" Great for pancakes: Works great as a cookie cutter, but my favorite use for this is making heart-shaped pancakes. I spray it with nonstick spray, put the cookie cutter on the griddle, and pour the pancake mix into the cookie cutter. Can't do that with a plain 'ol metal cookie cutter unless you want a burnt hand. I also used this cookie cutter to make heart-shaped cookies as party favors - they fit perfectly in cellophane party favor bags."" Trash: This book is a joke to be put in the trash with other garbage like books by Eric von Daniken. NATIVE AMERICANS built the mounds and were not influenced by Atlantians, Celts, Romans, Hebrews, or anyone other then Native American mound builders to come before them. To say that Native Americans could not have conceived the mounds is racist, pure and simple. This debate was put to rest over 100 years ago and it is laughable that there are still books and ""scientists"" disputing the FACT that Native Americans built these mounds."" The Perfect Explanation: This book is the perfect explanation of complex technologies and applications of broadband. While the book is crammed with details (many statistics cited), the authors' tone and style make it easily digestible. You would be hard pressed to find this quality of information presented so readily elsewhere. There is something for everyone, from engineering, business development, marketing as well as for the investor -- all will gain valuable insights. This breadth is one of the considerations that makes ""Delivering xDSL"" so special. As a professional in this vibrant industry, I credit this book with helping round out my knowledge tremendously. I am confident it will serve you as well." A GOOD READ: This book is very informative and easy to understand. It provides many insights into telecommunications and eliminates the confusion. I highly recommend it and it is a quick read." Book: Written by my favorite child behavior advisor, Jim Fey. This was a gift and I did read this one before giving it. I thought it was excellenst and coined the parents/guardians right on. Highly recommend this book for parents and teachers."" Perfect for Rich and Nave people: It is sad that another speculative diet such as Perricone's immediately become a bestseller. It is based on some hypothetical ""inflammation"" which ""you cannot see, you cannot feel"" but THIS is the key to successful weight lose. Of course, you have to buy several very expensive supplements and foods which are not affordable for the average income. As a medical doctor I can assure you that this book will NOT help you to solve your problem.Mariam Camara M.D."" Supplements too expensive: It's not that simple, or original. The cost of the supplements, which are the mainstay of the program, made the program prohibitive if I wanted the claimed results. I was very disappointed."" Compilation of Perricone's other books + a speculation: I have some of Perricone's other books. That's why I was surprised to see that many suggestions and recommendations from them are included in the content of this book as well. The ""new"" thing is his speculation that obesity is caused by some inflammatory process in the body. He does NOT point out ANY studies or scientific evidence for his claim. That's why his book is yet another speculative diet. I am in the middle of his 14 days plan and I did not see ANY weight loss. However, I am $560 poorer because I had to buy expensive supplements from his web site. So, if you are more in the beauty benefits or want recommendations for vitamins, minerals, herbs etc. directly go to his site and order whatever you like. There is no need to waste your time reading his book." Does the job: Easy to install. The plastic is fine - rigid enough to hold what I need. Slides out very smoothly. There is a sharp edge on the end of the runners that I just covered with tape." espanol version: as far as the shipping,ok,but the movie was in spanish.you cant win them allthe tape seemed to play ok,just couldnt understand it."" DVD please HBO!: Come on HBO, when are you doing to release this and ""Witch Hunt"" on DVD. There is a cult following for these two films and Lovecraft in general, do it!"" A gift for a happy little baker: I bought this kit for my God daughter, who is 16 years old, for Christmas.She loves baking and decorating and she listed a few items on her Christmas list.I was looking at this same kit at Joann's and Michael's and was going to pick it up and have it shipped, since I live out of state. But one day I was browsing through the Amazon website and saw this item. You can imagine how happy I was not only could I have it shipped directly from Amazon it was also less expensive!!She called me on Christmas Day and was so excited and started using her kit the very next day.. it had everything she needed to start right away and to learn new decorating methods.. Nice to know that even at teenagers you can still make them happy with a gift that can include others..It was great!"" Oblomov: OblomovAfter reading the book of Gontcharov, this film just feels so wrong and with no depht in the caracters, Olga seems a silly girl when the lovestory between her and Stoltz is not told, Stoltz appears too arrogant in that version of the story, all the strength of Gontcharov's language is missing in this film-adaptation! The actor of Oblomov is fantastic, but his caracter misses all the sadness of his downfall when the lovestory to his housekeeper is not told - so just never miss the real story, read the book!!!"" *_ENIGMA: Yet another journey from the enigma himself. Like every album, this one is unique and has a mind of it's own with of course the enigmatic flair. I can vividly imagine the celestial images when hearing it, and loving the layered and airy feel I constantly have it on replay. My favorite songs are; Eppur Si Muove, Feel Me Heaven, Dancing With Mephisto, Invisible Love, 20,000 Miles Over the Sea, Sitting on the Moon & Goodbye Milky Way. I gave this album 5 stars because of this man's incredible talent! He deserves it. Enigma has been my favorite since they started, because he gave me something to believe in." Awesome music!: I am a big fan of Enigma and am steadily collecting all the catalogue! I actually bought the digital version on iTunes - but wanted the physical CD. The music is hypnotic and trans- like - very Enigma!" Finally Someone talking about spirituality in Coaching: I'm on the Amazon website and soooo very excited to see yourbook there. Thanks goodness you wrote this! I've been calling myself aspiritual coach for years now it's good to have company like you. What Ilove about your timing of the book is that businesses are opening up tothis. I'm getting calls and jobs about bringing spirituality to work,finally. Now I have a great book to recommend.Melanie DewBerry-Jones"" A book complete with re-usable solutions: This is just the kind of book, that i have alwayswanted. It's packed with solutions for the working professional/hobbyist, from cover to cover - Zeropages wasted on frivolties.I was able to completely re-use the core of thesimple content management system into my personalwebsite, and it worked just perfectly fine. Ialso didn't have to type the code in by hand,as all the code was available from the publisherswebsite - Sweeeet!!!More books like this, and my wife and kids willbe a lot happier:-)"" Tubes not so great: A couple minutes after opening I decided to put the sorter to use. It jams every so often if you try to load a bunch of coins in it or go too fast. You have to seem to load an extra coin in yourself to make the tubes have the correct amount of money in them, the top always seems to be a coin short. Ive had a couple pennies fall into the dime tube out of about half a mug of coins."" Kid's Toy, not for Business, Non-Responsive Seller: The coin sorter is fine for kids, but is clumsy and worse, inaccurate. There were pennies in the nickel slot, dimes in with the quarters, and almost always over or short in each column. These over/shortages may be ok for a kid or weekend yard-seller, but for the banking and business world, there has to be a more accurate sorter."" Not worth the money or the trouble - just go to the bank!: I read the product reviews before purchasing this sorter...but, I'm wondering if the reviews I read are for the same product (MS1-Manual Coin Sorter, 1-Row, 7-19/64""x9-7/64""x8-19/64, Blue). I do not recommend this sorter (MS-1) as it is not worth the money or trouble!This sorter is too inaccurate for any use; it routinely sorted coins into the wrong slots (pennies in the nickel slot, dimes in with the quarters, etc) and is virtually always over or short in each coin row which, in my opinion, is not acceptable even for a kid or weekend yard-seller. What's the point of inaccurately sorting coins?Furthermore, the coins consistently overshoot the chutes and fall on the table or floor....really a pain! I should have returned it and suggest you spend your money on something fun or useful." Great Value: Way better than the electronic sorters you get for the same price. The coins sort very quickly with ease and jams are infrequent. The few times a coin has jammed I quickly tick the crank in the opposite direction before continuing without any further complications. I purchased this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend who always has change lying around the house. It works much better than the other sorter we had in which the coins ran down a track and were constantly jammed or smaller coins would go into larger rolls. Good value for the money and very easy to use." Royal No No Coin Machine: Though the idea of this machine was intriguing, it was useless. Many different coins went down slots meant for different denominations and it kept getting stuck. A shame, a waste of money."" I wanted to like this, but...: Seemed like a really good idea, but after trying two of these and having the keys stick, become hard to push and string long lines of letters together (i.e. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM), I'm sending it back." Clean yet dark and gritty.: An album which is thoroughly absorbing. Dragging you into to it's darkness. Yet at the same time the journey is pleasant with the lister wanting to hear more. Tracks 1 " not worth your precious time: ...this is one of the most horrible films ever. There's no ""plot"" whatsoever, the ""characters"" were all scrambling around for nothing and a wasted watching time. Better go out and run around your house!Totally not recommended at all."" Only For Beginers: In my opinion, this book is not worth buying, unless you are truly a beginner. And even then, you will quickly outgrow this book. It contains practices that you can quickly pick up at the stable where your lessons are. To learn them from others at your stable will more likely help you, because it will be in more detail and you will watch someone do it."" Love and Respect: A Seminal Work: As a Christian family counselor, I can say that without a doubt, this book has transformed my practice. Clients are always recommending books to me that they've found meaningful to them. In an effort to be respectful, I always try to at least look the book over. About seven years ago, a client insisted I read Love and Respect, and I uttered the customary response: ""I'll take a look"". From the moment I opened it, I could tell that this book was different. Since I began utilizing this book in virtually all marriage counseling sessions, cases that in the past had taken months or years to resolve, were suddenly transformed. In fact, the extent to which a couple a couple is able to adhere to the Love and Respect (biblical) principles, determines how quickly and completely they are able to resolve their issues. Thank you Dr. Eggerichs for this tremendous book.Lee L. MFT" Love and Respect: Helpful and to the point. It helps me and my wife. The advice contained here comes from accurate use of Ephesians 5. It makes good applications. Practical." This has been needed for years!: This is a great book based on what is most important to men and women in marriage. This is about traditional values of trying to make a marriage work by making your spouse's needs your priority. I would not recommend it for people who are in abusive verbal, emotional or physical relationships. This is for people who have a basically good person they're married to, but it seems that they cannot connect. Awesome book!"" The Light Bulb Has Come On!: Having been raised in the Baptist church, I was always aware of the fact that the husband should love his wife as himself. This book explains exactly what that means and also explains the part that most people leave out. This is that a wife must respect (give reverence to) her husband.My wife and I still have our moments but we both have a different perspective now. We try to avoid the ""Crazy Cycle"" like it is the plague!" Excellent: Wonderful book... written and organized in a reader-friendly way. I love the fact that the theme of the book is taken directly from Scripture. Love and Respect: Received the book in a timely fashion in excellent condition. It is a very good book for couples." great book: excellent book. every married couple should read it. you will take away good, useful advice."" Every couple should read this book!: This book revolutionized the way I think! It has helped me to understand my own reactions to things as well as those of my fiance`. Dr. Eggerichs brings out in a simple way what the Bible has been saying all along about the respective needs of men and women. After applying the principles of respectful responses in my conversations (and even thoughts towards) with my fiance`, our relationship has deepened and our love is much stronger. His responses to me are becoming more and more tender....and that makes me respect him even more! WOW! I feel like I discovered the pot of gold at the end of relationship rainbow!"" Love and Respect: This is the perfect book. If all couples followed the advice from this book, we would have beautiful marriages! This book is Biblically based,it makes perfect sense. We just need to put it into practice!"" classic punk movie: The movie first and foremost is cheap. The cast are actually street kids from the local area. But even with a amateur cast the film still winds up to be both a gritty and yet cautionary tale of youth gone wrong and the inability of the local community to cope with them. The story centers around a group of latch-key or worse kids and their squat in the middle of a run down section of town. The kids band together and call themselves The Rejected which for some of kids is actually true. The Rejected find themselves in the sight of the local townsfolk(militia?)who see them as being a terror to their neighborhoods which to give them credit is half true. The movie features live performances from TSOL, The Vandals, & DI. Again the production value is poor but the message is strong and should be heard." a classic!: This movie still lives on in my 31  Cult Classic: See Emilio Estevez in a whole new light. This is one weird and funny 80's movie. I loved it and so will you." Geat CD: ""Shotgun"" by Michael Beatty demonstrates an artist transitioning to a more eclectic sound than his last recording ""Night Traveler"". There seems to be an element of electronic music, of electro-beat, slipping gently through the songs. Beatty's keyboard work is familiar, carrying a kind of Carol King sound, especially on track 6, ""ghostlight"".There is even a hint of island music most notable on track 1, ""cold heart"" and track 9, ""the quiet joys of brotherhood"".Like all of Beatty's music, ""Shotgun"" is infinitely cool. The music drifts like a trail of sensuous, delicious smoke from a mysterious flame. The layers of sound are like transparent silks drifting lazily in a breeze.I strongly recommend this CD for those listening for the new creative voices. There is lots of strong writing, mixing and singing here. Check out ""the quiet joys of brotherhood"" my favorite track."" Great CD: I think this CD by Alice Deejay is great. I love to listen to it everytime. The song ""Better Off Alone"" is my favorite song right now. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves to dance all night long." Best Ever: Words can't describe this CD. It is the best there is. I can listen to it forever and never get sick of it. It is a must buy! best out of 5 or so I've tried: I have bought about 5 different headsets over 6mo period and all of them had problems with mic level (there were calls where it was ok but a lot of those where it was really weak). I almost gave up thinking that I'm going to have to go to a professional grade teleconferencing equipment when my wife bought this one which seems to have fixed the problem." Terrible transmission: Nice and light weight but for some reason it garbles my voice unless I put my hand in front of my mouth to direct my voice to the ovedrly short microphone. People complained about the voice distortion so I called my voice mail to check it out. Yep, terrible sound and I am returning it."" Gorecki's Spectacular ""Sorrows Symphony"": This is a truly beautiful piece. I would recommend reading the insert that accompanies the disk as it gives a insightful description of how the music was first performed the the influences surrounding Gorecki while composing this wondrous piece. Dawn Upshaw does an artistic interrpretation of the polish text, by taking care and not over singing this. I highly recommend this as it is beautiful, tragic and yet holds hope for the future. This is truly an amazing recording. Also, please note that this recording was done in 2 "" How do you calibrate it???: I put this in my computers gameport I have windows 98 and I went to the control panel and it was on the list so I clicked it than it said ""not connected."" I tried going to add new hardware it just didn't work."" Second disc makes it 5 star album...: This is a superb live effort from moe. All the songs are very representative of a good moe. show. The first disc is great, but the second one absolutely rocks to no end, making you wish there was a third disc. The jams are exceptionally well crafted and tight throughout. Even if you've never heard moe. this would be a great starting place. I would even add this 2 " A Great Step by Step Guide: This book really is for beginners but a great book to have. I am 15 years old and it taught me alot about horse handling. My favorite part of the book was about what kind of tack to use. It gave basic knowledge about horses which was very useful." I carry it everywhere I go!: I very much enjoy using my franklin MWD-1490 dictionary... I take it everywhere I go... Love the games as well.However it has no backlight so you can only use it if there's light around and there are certain programs in it that are hard to use, if you make a mistake in your typing there's no way of deleting w/ some of the programs." DISGUSTING BRATS WHAT YOU ARE!: I HATE THIS ITEM. IT BEARLY HAS ANY WORDS.IT SHUTS OFF WHEN IT FEELS LIKEIT." Worth a try: I found the book to be very well written and it was very moving. I have to admit, however, that the reading was quite difficult, perhaps because I come from a Western background and Rushdie wrote it from an Indoeuropean one."" Satanic Verses: Finally got around to reading this and must say it is one of the worst books I have ever encountered.It is dull, rambling, a real case of fishing for some sense in writing that flies and thuds with equal abandon,so that finishing it is more like punishment than pleasure."" Piece of garbage: I read it in the late 80s in the height of the furor over the book. A good book, I'll read quickly straight through. This book took weeks. I read 5 other books while I was reading this one and finished all of those before finishing Rushdie. Without the fatwa, this book would still be selling form its first printing.Awful.Boring.Without point or meaning.Far too many better books out there to read than to waste your time with this." Garbage for Idiots: What a piece of thrash this book is ! Most of Rushdie's supporters havent even read the book or understand it fully because of they lack an understanding of the hindi/urdu language in which Rushdie hides his blatant insults against Islam. The End." The Stupid (Sorry--Satanic) Verses: Since ""The Satanic Verses"" first came out and the Muslim world got so upset about it I often wondered what Rushdie had said in the book that was so bad. So I bought a copy and read the first couple of hundred pages before giving up out of sheer boredom. Now, I have two Masters Degrees in Engineering, I have a several thousand book personal library, I am well read and not exactly stupid but I STILL DO NOT see what is so bad about the book to demand the author being killed. It is a grossly unreadable book but other than that I see nothing wrong with it. But I do not recommend spending even the 49 cents I spent to buy yourself even a used copy! Vic H." Salman's word salad: This book makes absolutely no sense at all. Mostly rambling diatribe to fill pages and call it a novel. A waste of money." A challenging but powerful and even entertaining novel.: In the more famous half of the novel, Rushdie was trying to be the Islamic Voltaire--challenge Muslim fundamentalists and examine their faith in the light of history; but the rest of the book is devoted to an impassioned exploration of the lives of South Asian immigrants living in England, focussing on the prejudice and ignorance of the British. It is also a very funny book, provided you don't identify too closely with the targets of his satire. Some specialized knowledge will help you enjoy the book more. Such knowledge is available in my Web notes to the book. If you have a taste for highly intellectual multicultural satire, the book can be thoroughly enjoyable." Worthless: This is the most worthless book I have read. I fail to understand why Rushdie's work always makes big news. This book in particular is extremely diifcult to understand and in most part very dull in narration. Rushdie has used extensive hindi/urdu language to make reading as complex as possible. Has literature come to a point where books get high rating because of the name of the author associated with it? This book has no more to offer except Rushdie's credentials. You will be better not wasting your time on this garbage!" Rushdie's most difficult book, but still worthwhile: This book, like all of Rushdie's work, depicts the conflicts of the immigrant. Here that is expressed in religious terms; the story is about loss of faith, told from the perspective of one of the characters, Gibreel Farishta (which translates to the Angel Gabriel). It is woven into a second narrative based on medieval Muslim accounts of Gabriel's revelation of Islam to Muhammad. Unfortunately, this subtlety of the narrative was lost amidst the brouhaha that followed Khomeini's death sentence on Rushdie."" Writing style: I was really excited about this book after reading all the great reviews both on amazon and in the paper. However, I couldn't get past the first chapter without great annoyance. The lyrical writing style the author uses apparently resonates with some readers, but I felt it was too sing-song and that his style got in the way of the story. If I could return the book, I would."" Needs an editor: ""The Secret"" to a great golf swing is still not apparent after reading this book. It's likely that Mike Cortson could teach you this secret if you took a private lesson from him, but that information is just not clearly presented here. He writes as if he's giving you a lesson face-to-face, bad grammar and all.To replicate one of his shot diagrams, take a bunch of triangles and arrows, apply random titles on top of them, and past them onto a page. That's it.This book needs an editor and a real illustrator pronto.I wish I could give 0 out of 5 stars to offset the unusual string of 5 star reviews."" Nothing New Here: Not recommended. There is nothing new in this slim volume. I gave the author the benefit of the doubt, but I was wrong. You won't find any secrets here that will improve your game unless you have never taken a golf lesson or never read another golf book."" One of The Best Books On Introductory Analysis: When I got this book I feel in love with it! This is a great book on introductory analysis. It even has a section multivariate analysis. I highly recommend it's use in introductory mathematical analysis courses. There is only one book I could compare with this book and it is Steven R. Lay's Analysis With An Introduction to Proof. However, I think Lay lacks several things that this book has. Yes, many people would say Rudin is the best but I disagree. Rudin is not student friendly because I have used it and many students fail the homework assignments assigned from it unless they have the problems already worked out from another source. One day when I become a math professor I will be lecturing from this book."" come on: you've turned on the tv before and seen the most horrible movie playing and within 3 minutes the channel was changed. right?ed wood's movies are exactly the same. somehow their reputation exceeds them, but they are just boring and awful messes. there's nothing funny or exciting about them. it's like watching someone else's home movies. please.."" Stopped working after one year: This is junk. Like the other reviewer who found the buttons stopped working, I did too. I opened it up and found it is has super cheap components that will fail with time through oxidation. Pay a bit more and get something that lasts."" Beautiful, simply beautiful: I had purchased this CD in a used bin from my local record store more than six years ago. I had heard a brief news story on this CD from CNN, and I decided to take a chance on this ... bargain.Boy, did I ever make the right call. I knew almost next to nothing about George Gershwin, but the music on this CD was simply too magical. All the familiar melodies and song I had heard one time or another in my life (like the United Airlines commercial from ""Rhapsody in Blue"") jumped right from my boombox. You can feel Gershwin's energy and intensity in each and every one of these songs, and there were times that I would be swept away in excitement by the speed and emotions.I know I did a poor job in describing this CD, but I can guarantee you that if you like piano melodies, this CD should definitely belong in your collection. After all these years, it is still one of my favorites."" Great for business and MBA: Great device!The best that I've had. Unfortunately, the battery cover is too fragile and broken.The worst thing is that now this model from HP is discontinued"" what a film, oh, what a film: This si on my top ten film list of all times, a modern masteropiece, everything about this film, every last detail is perfect from the supporting actor to the leads, the music, the director, the angles fro mthe cameras, the artistic filmography, the lighting, the dialogue, the facial expression on teh actor, the plot. ALL perfect"" You're Not in Paris Anymore Amelie: This is a dark, atmospheric film about illegal immigrants who become entangled in the weird goings-on taking place in the hotel where they work. The film begins slowly and allows the viewer to discover the secrets along with the actors as they discover they are in over their heads. An edge of your seat finale has a wonderful twist. Superb acting and an unusual story make this film a winner."" Great performance, reasonable cost: We've been running an earlier version of this model(2 "" so far so good.: I got it (Nov 2012) for a good price and once I read the manual as to how to read the control panel, it was easy to run. I researched this unit to make sure about the cost of replacement filters. I can get replacement filters as well as prefilters for a good price for it at my usual filter replacement store ""filtersfast.com"" It runs quietly and has a nice clean look to it. I will repost if I have any trouble with it over the coming days."" terrific fun ... even for someone who cringes at the word 'musical' and 'movie' together: First, this is a review of the movie, not the DVD as I saw Mamma Mia! in the theater.I only went to see the beautiful Greek scenery, having no interest in seeing a musical, nor in Abba songs, nor in Mamma Mia! the musical from stage. I expected to be a bit bored, and boy was I happily mistaken!This movie is a whole lot of fun. The actors are great. There is madcap sort of storyline about a woman who raises her daughter alone on a Greek island and the men who may be that girl's father. It's great fun, over the top, madcap, even silly humor. The songs fit right in and just add to the fun spirit of the movie. What a great summer movie this is.I don't recall every plot twist and turn, but do recall feeling very happy and entertained. It's a very upbeat movie.And of course, the scenery is beautiful."" Pretty boring and predictable: I heard great things about this movie, especially Meryl Streep. Although her performance was good, the movie dragged. Not as exciting as the Broadway play. The biggest comic relief was Pierce Brosnan's attempt at singing.... and that wasn't supposed to be funny. Just awful!!"" I used to like ABBA...: I used to like ABBA, until I saw Mama Mia! A horribly disjointed musical, where songs feel contrived to fit into the story; a story that doesn't seem to come together. Individual songs are usually done alright, but don't segue from one to another very well.The cast butchered several of the songs, but especially S.O.S, Take A Chance On Me, and anything where Pierce Brosnan sang. On a side note, I also counted at least two violations of Chekov's Gun. And finally, I think it has a bad moral message. Which you only recognize if you manage to sit through the whole thing.If there is justice in the world, cast members without established careers won't get to have them as punishment for the worst movies I've seen since The Talented Mr. Ripley." Awful: I love cheesy movies and a fair number of musicals BUT this has to be a joke. This movie is breaking records for 2008??? There are maybe two songs that faired an okay from me-the rest I was cringing every time the actors opened their mouths. I love Meryl and I doubt that I'll ever be able to prop her back on the pedestal I had her on after this. This is bad. This is a very bad film and I couldn't dare recommend this to my worst enemy." Definitely a ""chick flick"": Please keep in mind that this 2 "" Mamma Mia: Very poor show! An adaptation of a stage play that had very poor scenery,plot,idiotic characters and poor choreography. A real dud."" Mama Mia Go Go Go!!!!!: This musical movie was great! So what Pierce did not hit the notes as some opera singers. It is light hearted and funny. Give James Bond (Pierce) credit, bet he had a blast making the movie. Don't listen to the reviews that seem to knit pick, go and see it and now buy it and enjoy...You'll want to get up and dance!!!" A waste of Meryl Streep's talent: This is an utterly stupid movie that completely wastes Meryl Streep's phenomenal acting power. The nicest part of this movie was the ocean in the background.... Meryl is again Awesome!: Enjoyed the movie. Love Abba. Thought Meryl was awesome. So much fun to watch and sing along." Better each time: Mama Mia took us by surprise. What are these other-than-musical actors doing headlining a musical.The characters were great. The actors fit the characters. It was fun, fun, fun.The second time we liked it more.We look forward to seeing it the next time we're ready for an upper." Great MOVIE: Arrived in excellent conition. DVD was sealed as described.Love this movie and the music. Not for mature adults: This movie is definitely for the younger crowd and not for adult viewing. It is totally nonsensical and not wworth watching." Charming movie: Yes, it's a chick flick--and no, I'm not a chick--but this is a really nice movie. It was written to showcase the music of ABBA, and it does, which makes the sound track alone worth the price of the rental. Going to purchase the disk to add to my library!"" Here We Go Again: Look, I'm here to help you. Hopefully, you'll read this review before the Holidays and you'll buy or rent something worthy of your friends and family to view, something like Sin City or Death Proof but please God, not Mamma Mia. This film is so bad that the people who didn't walk out after 15 minutes decided it was better to just make fun of it by making inappropriate and often times hilarious comments throughout. There's you're warning. Now if you're still intent on seeing this film because Meryl Streep is in it, I want you to remember one thing. This is the same woman who made She-Devil with Roseanne Bar in 1989. Save yourselves.Your welcome."" a true musical: I loved this movie! It is funny, corney and heart warming.Be prepared to laugh. The movie arrived timely and in great shape."" Surprised: I had no intention of seeing the movie because I could not stand the bubble-gum music of Abba. The video store was out of everything I wanted to see so I rented the movie so I could see what my coworkers were raving about. Well, it did have Streep and I'd watch Brosnan peel potatoes all day...he is yummy! What I didn't count on was how good the movie was and I'm very distressed to see that I find myself singing the songs and even buying the DVD. Abba? Julie Waters' version of ""Take a chance"" is wonderful and Streep's ""Winner takes it all"" made me cry. Granted, Brosnan's singing is a tad painful but it was passable. I loved the movie and now I'm a fan. I wish they had a package that had both the DVD and the CD soundtrack of the movie bundled."" Mamma Mia fun: The Blu-ray version of this energetic film adds even more ways to be caught up in the fun. The crystal clear images and superb sound live up to expectations. The interviews, commentary, and sing alongs keep you coming back for more. If you are looking for lighthearted entertainment, this is an excellent choice."" Mamma Mia DVD: My daughter and I love this movie, even bought the soundtrack. We both like Abba songs and there were some songs on soundtrack and movie I have never heard of and now I am in love with these songs."" Mamma Mia DVD Review: I didn't know Meryl Streep and Pierce Bronson could sing! That was a nice surprise.This was a really fun musical with some very zany, unique and creative dances and scenes and plots. I LOVED the scene of a bunch of guys doing a dance on the dock with flippers. I laughed many times during this musical and it was such a joyous experience watching it for the first time. It was also fun to hear the old ABBA songs I haven't heard for years, and loved so much as a kid.For a musical tho, I was surprised that they didn't cast singers with stronger vocals. They were passable for sure, but the vocals weren't excellent, which you usually do find in musicals. But, that also may have added to the quirkiness of this musical."" What a great time!: When I saw the trailor, I had no interest in seeing the movie. My mom said I have to see it, so we went together and boy am I glad I did! I laughed, I cried (the song when the mother and daughter are preparing her for the wedding ceremony). We saw it three times in the theater, and have pre-ordered the set (hopefully lots of bonus goodies). Who knew the ""Big Love"" daughter had such a voice?! If you love Grease and other musicals, this is a sure thing."" Swing like crazy, man!: If you buy this record, get ready to dance your heinie off! Man this swings so hard you just can't help getting out of your chair to shake your bum. Not even the softest, cushiest, coziest Lay-Zee-Boy reclining armchair will prevent you from doing so. No kidding. Even if you are the laziest son-of-a-gun on your side of the Mississippi, you won't be able to help yourself. The swingin' power of this album is impossible to resist."" How is Giorgio Moroder, too?: This is an electronic pop band, a debut album of a yellow magic orchestra. In 1978, there were few musicians who made music with computer control in the world . YMO introduced a computer for music that was still released for a recording process in those days into boldness and created such masterpieces. However, though YMO makes music, a true reason does not say instead because it merely lacked hands, and the reason is because YMO is opposed to the strong sense of rhythm that a black musician has in what it does not possibly match, and it was going to use power of a machine. As a result, it may be said that it is irony of the history that music of YMO had a great influence on black music of the present age. This record made use of an echo by re-mixture by Al Schmitt; is easy to hear it; is finished, but this is not the thing which aimed at of YMO."" Never so true!: Book is great, our son loves it. Great story and very relevant to today's issues. Berenstain Bears are always worth the money."" My kids loved these books: My kids have enjoyed every one of the Berenstain books and I like them too because they all teach a lesson in a non-preachy way. Unfortunately. the other lesson they all teach is that Papa is at best just another child, and at worst a buffoon. Sort of like the foolish fathers on the sitcoms."" Great purchase; just what I needed for school: I needed a financial calculator for school. I priced them in local office supply stores and got ""sticker shock."" I searched for the calculator on Amazon.com and was able to buy a brand new calculator for $20 less than retail. I highly recommend Amazon.com."" Great Calculator But New Version Disappointed: I have used the HP-12c for years and wanted to get an extra, hoping to get a complete set of user manuals. The ""new"" HP-12C arrived in original packaging but I was disappointed that HP chose to not provide the printed user manuals, instead they sent one small booklet and then a CD. Also, it was not possible to get the calculator into the case, the fit was just too tight. After pushing the calculator into the case, it tore in the bottom corner. HP always did a nice job with their calculators, but the cheapness of the case and lack of manuals did not impress me, I guess compromising quality is a way to save money. One area they went all out for was the packaging, Getting this thing out of the package was a chore!!!"" Too complicated: I work in a mortgage office where 80% of my co-workers have this calculator because it's the one management recommends. Did I mention that my company has a contract with HP? Can anyone say ""conflict of interest""?I've been in the financial business for 10 years, and my Texas Instruments BA-II does exactly the same job with easier-to-understand buttons, at half the price."" A ONCE GREAT PRODUCT - NOW SIMPLY CEAP AND TAWDRY: I use the HP12c almost every day for financial planning and have worn out four of them.Each time I buy a replacement, I am surprised by the reduced quality.The last one I purchased works, but its a bit of junk. Shame on you HP. For this price I don't need sticky keys, a degraded case, and a fragile cover.If you can find an old one, in good condition, buy that. At this price, HP should be building a quality product, but alas, they now build junk.HP has, unfortunately, lost its way." THE Classic in the industry: There is no better financial calculator than the HP12C. An industry standard that separates the clerks from the financiers. I prefer to use HP 12 " This whiteboard is HORRIBLE: It does NOT ""dry erase"" at all. It requires a ridiculous amount of rubbing or a spray of some cleaner to get the marker off. It defeats the whole purpose. Besides that, it is fine >:-/" Not impressed!: The best thing about this DVD is the cover. It had terrible graphics and general info. I was looking forward to leaning something new about bears and was given a docum. largely on N. American bears." ""powerful story of human dignity & strife against all odds"": This is a powerful true story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.) ~ the first African-American diver in the U.S. Navy. Despite the ruthless interference of his training officer Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) the obstacle for Carl's dream seems to be unreachable. But Sunday sees the system is wrong ~ and Brashear's goal is clear ~ and his determination is fixed.The performances of De Niro and Gooding Jr. is crismatic, when they're on the screen together ~ your eyes never leave them, the electricity is evident ~ there is a lump in your throat. This is what the films of the '40s was all about ~ character, committment, your word ~ and most of all HONOR!Hats off to ~ George Tillman Jr. (director) ~ Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr giving ""Oscar-Winning"" performances...believe this is one of the best films to come out of ""Hollywoodland"" for some time.Total Time: 128 Minutes...20th Century Fox...(2001)"" Good Movie, A Bit Too Long.: Men Of Honor is the story of a poor black man who after joining the Navy desperately wants to become the highest rank of Navy Diver. The movie takes you through his trials and tribulations dealing with his superior officers trying to keep him from obtaining his goal. The movie is part inspirational, part love story and very dramatic. The writing is good and the movie is believable (it is after all based on a true story). My only complaint is that the movie drags on a little. If the movie were a half hour shorter I would give it 5 out of 5 stars but length makes this a 4 out of 5 star review."" The ""coating"" over the letters is peeling off...: I was surprised that this received such high praise (and glad I didn't pay the retail price). We bought this used but in new condition, and after a few months, the coating on several of the letters is starting to peel off. If you don't put the letters in just right, the corners catch, and I think that's what's causing the damage. At least one of the letters (maybe N for Noodle) jams if put in upside down. And is elbow macaroni really a ""noodle""? Not the worst toy out there, but not a five-star item, either." It's Time for an Update on Phil: This is a good book. I like Spiritual Hoops a little better even though Mind Games has 11 " Not a good set: I bought the cd set before I left for Korea to teach English. It is not a very good set for learning Korean. Sure, it will give you some useful expressions, but a lot of the expressions I did not use in Korea (I was there for almost 3 years). The pronunciation was off, too. It was not accurate, at times, concerning words. When I said 'excuse me' as instructed by the set, my co-teacher laughed at me because it was the wrong word! I have studied languages before (Spanish, Japanese, French (degreed in French))and the Pimsleur set is not one that I would ever recommend."" sad but true: John hit on so many funny aspects of living in the north woods and working on vehicles. The humor stands the test of time. The fact is, winter and truck repair will indeed have you doing some soul serching." GROW your kid early!: I bought this for my nephew at 2  Not for my: This movie is totally a junk i recomend more the original version who is more better than thisPD:One the worst remake i ever seen" Not good.: I liked the original much better. I never liked Jamie Lee Curtis. Lindsey whatever her name is doesn't hold a candle to Jodie Foster, and no, I am not just saying that the old one is better b/c it came out when I was a girl and I like to live in the past, I'm 18. So that's saying something"" I'd say 6 stars! yay: This is an extremly sweet and cute movie. It's a movie that leaves you feeling really good inside. It's warm, comforting, funny, crazy, beautiful....Jamiee Lee Curtis is amazing in it. She is simply amazing, acting as a person who got switched with her 15 year old teenage daughter! Her facial ezpressions, her ""ewww's"" and attitude is great to watch. It's my first time seeing a Lindsay Lohan movie, and I am impressed by this pretty young red-head. She was the perfectly stiff, middle aged woman trying to realise that the teen life is grueling after all.I lovded this, also the Bonus Features are great. behind the scenes and deleted scenes, are a real glimpse into how everything's done."" Poor, so very poor thus far: I have read the first 4 chapters of this book and it is poorly written! I am not a newbie to Java (this book states that you should have previous knowledge of Java) but yet the presentation style of the material is confusing!It is a required text for a graduate level class in Java - i will come back and complete my review once i have finished reading the book.***********************************Update....uggghhhhhhhhhh!!!!Finished the book and no change in opinion..... in addition book binding is atrocious!!... its is falling apart after 4 months of careful useOk Ok - its not all that bad - sections on design patterns are ok. But overall just a below average book!" Fantastic!: I love these Gentle Giant sculptures. They all have such great detail and look so much like the characters in the movies! This one arrived quickly and in perfect condition as well. Great Little Book: Well written - cute tricks that aren't hard.... I took this book step by step and made sure my dog knew each one in succession. Tricks are built upon other commands.... - so it's not a 'fast book'.... sometimes it take a week to get to the next one. Great suggestions though. Love is a dream: I have looked forward to seeing this movie for over a year; ever since I heard Ms. Kaas' music from the movie last summer. I was not disappointed. Jeremy Irons was wonderfully handsome. Patricia Kaas was as beautiful as her voice. I loved the multiple story lines and characters. Claude Lelouch has another winner. I have used this calculator before but would not buy it from this supplier.: I have bought and used this calculator before but not from this supplier. I was traveling went it arrived so I didn't open the package for a month. When I did open the calculator didn't work and when I contacted the supplier they said it was two late. I was 3 days after the cut off. I would never buy from these people again." Rick's replacement calculator: My husband lost a calculator he had used for 25 years. We were so excited to find the exact replacement!! It was a nostalgia thing. And he thinks I'm wonderful for finding it. Ha So happy you had it in your ""inventory""."" Even better than I had hoped for: I thought I was going to be watching another 'quirky indie' movie, similar to 'Little Miss Sunshine', with which it shares producers and co-star Alan Arkin. Actually, while still very funny in places, it ended up being much more dramatic than expected, and a nice little film about family and growing up. Starring my new favorite actress, a dressed-down Amy Adams, and Emily Blunt as her irresponsible younger sister, it follows their adventures as they start their own business, cleaning up crime scenes. The ride takes them on several side roads, including class reunions and a strange friendship with Mary Lynn Rajskub (""Chloe"" of '24'). The overall feel reminds me of another movie I loved last year - 'Waitress'. Maybe not a wall-to-wall laugh riot, but tender and memorable, and still enough smiles to make you walk out happy."" Scary ....: If you want to scare the daylight out of your guests, keep one of these in their room. When they go to sleep and turn the lights out - all the animals sound off in unison, they would never suspect the harmless looking peg puzzle for the noise it makes. Even with the pieces in place, it starts making the ""farm animal"" noise when the lights are turned on/off."" Funniest Book I've Read in Years: Song of Sorcery is hilarious. The characters are interesting, and real.(Well, mostly.) Anyone looking for a good time without the disembowling and stereotypical protegenists, this is it."" Not Impressed: I sat and viewed this DVD with my son. He paid attention the entire video. But I thought it was boring and very cheap and poorly put together. The information of what its teaching is good, but the production quality is very low."" Great!: My 18 month old child loves this video. At first, I did not like the poor animation and found the English narrator and subtitles to be distracting. However, now I love it and think that the songs are quite catchy. I still wish there was a function on the DVD to get rid of the subtitles." ANIMATION NEEDS WORK +BAD SPANISH: We have tried them all and this DVD was a disapointment. The animation was really bad as well as some of the articulation. Some situations did not relate to very young ones and it would not hold the attention of my child." Scissor sisters ta dah album: This is another brilliant album from the group, i have listened to the album most days since buying it, it's great even my husband likes it. They have some really upbeat songs to sing and dance along to, well worth it. Can't wait for the next one, BRING IT ON !!!" Difficult to read: The author explains his physical experience on awakening the Kundalini but fails to explain his spiritual experience.The book could take 50% more editing. His pseudo-scientific explantions are difficult to follow." THIS BOOK SHATTERED ALL MYTHS...: I THINK IT IS MY DESTINY AND GOODFORTUNE,I CAME ACCROSS THIS 'FACINATING' BOOK. IT WAS RECOMENDED BY A WISE FRIEND OF MINE,WITH AN ADWISE TO 'STUDY ' IT.IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET INTO THE 'GROOVE'...AFTER THAT COULD NOT PUT DOWN THE BOOK..IT WAS A THRILLER!!I AM 52YEARS OLD NOW,ALL MY LIFE I HAVE READ ALL SORTS OF 'SPIRITUAL BOOKS',LISTENED TO SOME GOOD PEOPLE,FORMED MY OWN OPINION ABOUT 'GOD'..SOUL..PURPOSE OF OUR LIVING..WORSHIPPING..ETC.SUDDENLY THIS BOOK BY PANDIT GOPI KRISHNA...SHATTERED ALL MY CONCEPTS/VIEW POINTS, ABOUT ''GOD''AND 'SPIRITUALITY.NOW I BELEIVE THERE IS NO 'GOD' ..THERE IS ONLY'ENERGY'ALL AROUND US..AND THE SAME ENERGY IS IN EVERY ONE OF US..IF IT IS 'AWAKENED'IN YOU...THATS ''NIRWANA''OR THE PURPOSE OF YOUR LIFE...IF YOU ARE 'BLESSED''YOU WILL READ THIS BOOK..YOU MAY CONTACT ME IF YOU WANT TO..E.MAIL.. may the 'energy'bless us all."" This CD is ""The Bomb""! (from D. Lamonica to Warren Wells): Whenever I listen to this CD, I think of all those old ""NFL Game of the Week"" TV shows, or throwing the football with my cousin when I was a kid, humming the great NFL music while pretending to make a diving catch for the winning touchdown. Gonna play this on SuperBowl Sunday! If you love the old NFL Films shows of the past, buy it. My only question is... when is vol. 2 "" Facenda is God: When John Facenda talks, mortals listen. The problem is that most of this CD comprises musical soundtrack intended to be the backdrop of video. What is lacking is the video. This CD should not be sold; instead, it should be only a DVD so that you could see the football action that was originally intended to be the focal point of this music.The best of this CD: The Autumn Wind, of course. It's poetry. It's pure John Facenda. It's legend. It's football. The rest of the orchestration should be relegated to the soundtrack of what I am now longing to see on my television, which unfortunately is staring back at me without any expression whatsoever.Long live John Facenda. (Now how about showing us his face in the recording studio?)"" If you grew up with NFL Films, this is the music you want: My friends and I have loved this music since the early days of this week in pro football. I listened to the CD on the way to work this morning and still have chills. Thank you Tommy Boy Records and Steve Sabol for making my dream come true"" Very funny: Tom and Jerry was my favourite cartoon when I was a boy and this DVD contains some of the best cartoons of this inseparable duo. The animation and music are excellent. This is real value for your money.These magical and hilarious cartoons are recommended for all Tom and Jerry fans, both the young and young at heart."" Meh: Played with a close group of friends, there's really nothing to the game. The object is to pose a question, and then see who would have answered it a certain way... with friends that know you well, especially in a smaller group, it's more fun to just read the cards than play the game.Seemed like a great idea, but when we sat down to play it was outright boring and predictable. For a group of people who really don't know each other at all, it could be a great way to open up and have some fun; I wouldn't recommend it for less than 4 or 6 players even then." Loaded with fun!: This game is an excellent way to learn more about old and new friends alike. It is both fun and addictive. My friends and I have played it several times and still can't get enough. I've yet to find someone who doesn't enjoy this game." Great time!: I only bought this because my gf was looking for audition materials for an acting audition, so I thought it might have something she could use. Loved the ""Lady Day and Lester"" piece by Oyamo. What an eye opener! The heat, the fever of a dream as a man is dying were superbly captured in that seemingly bizarre story that Mr. Young could well have experienced in his final hours. Great stuff from so many fine writers."" The fallacies of hype: This film is one of the most gripping and tormenting films I've watched, even though it's decidedly difficult for me to relate to the people and scenes in Falls City; I am a student attending a New England prep school for intellecutally gifted girls from mostly socially prominent families, and it's hard for me to imagine squandering precious time in bars, loitering around in squalid settings without a single purpose in life.Also, I take exception to many reviewers' praises about Hilary Swank's acting. She's a good actress, but she's no where close to the breathtaking talents possessed and displayed by the likes of Emily Watson, Isabelle Adjani, Cate Blanchett, Natasha Regnier. Nor does she has the incandescent beauty of a Julie Delpy."" Great Acting, Horrible & Sick Storyline: Hilary Swank desirved evrything she won for this film but the rest of the actors and the story itself shouldn't have won anything, If Swank wasn't in this I wouldn't have given it any stars. It made so sick that this actually happened in reality. One of 99's WORST along with American Bueaty."" An Exercise in Easy Self Congratrulation: It's remarkable that one year features two Hollywood films that win all the awards yet fail to challenge the thinking of the big city people who pass them out. I didn't think a stronger exercise in big city (non-suburban) self congratulation than ""American Beauty"" existed, but I had not yet seen ""Boys Don't Cry."" Who is honestly challenged by this complacent examination of homophobia in small town, white trash America? As regards the majority of the kinds of people who will flock to such a film, isn't ""Boys Don't Cry"" banging on an already open door? There's no real conflict of views, since one side is obviously sympathetic and ""advanced,"" the other benighted and beneath contempt. Neither the skill of the acting nor the technical polish of the photography and direction can remove the inevitable boredom that always afflicts tales of Giant the Jack killer."" Not what I expected: I had been using Maguires vinyl protectant on my cars' vinyl top and thought it was all right, but I needed to re-apply every week to keep up the good look. I tried this product in hopes of having the top looking better longer, but that is not what I got. The top looks okay, but it doesn't quite have that look that Maguire's gives, and I still find myself re-applying it often. I guess I have to keep looking for that one product that will give a good, long-lasting look (even if long-lasting is 2 " I think it is so cute for Christmas!: I heard it on the radio for the first time this morning and I loved it. It's a great christmas song." Worst actual concert footage I've ever seen: The directors predilection for 2-3 second ""swooping"" camera cuts make the actual concert footage almost un-watchable. Show the artist, who cares about the crowd?"" Another Mark Haefeli edited disaster DVD: Like some other reviewers said, great music, great scenery, great everything, except for the 15 to 20 frame (less than a second) constant jump cut editing by Mark Haefeli that makes the video unwatchable. Watch a strobe light blinking for 2 "" A documentary NOT a music video!: Someone somewhere obviously said ""OOOOH we don't want just an ordinary boring old music video do we?"" NOOOO We must place in historical context! Great! Let's get the HISTORY CHANNEL in and RAMBLE ON AND ON AND ON about how the Beatles provided hope to the Russians! ZZZZZZZZZ. This DVD is really a documentary with music added on- the chapters annoyingly don't link to the start of each song and you often can't tell when the song has started as you have scenes of Russian life instead of Mr. McCartney on stage (so you can't just scroll through to find the start of the song). If that wasn't bad enough they interrupt ""the Fool on the Hill"" with historical commentary. Unfortunately the history gets more attention on this DVD than the music. 2 " Not bad but...: Not a bad collection of Funk jams but it features mostly cuts from the Stone Jam album which was recently re-released. Now if they would just re-release Showtime I'd buy two copies of it. Showtime was Slave's best album and is not as well represented here as it should be. But Slave is so good and so important in the history of Funk music that I still give this best of collection four stars. NYPD BLUE Season 2: Pouvez-vous m'indiquer quand les autres saisons de 3 Ã  12 " Always Excellent: NYPD Blue is, was and always will be reliably excellent television programming. It's a shame it ended...but fortunately for us, we have the opportunity to have each season so wonderfully preserved!"" skip this one: Possibly Lem's worst novel. A lot of bad ideas mixed with his obsessiveness led to the worst collection of short stories imaginable. Cheap humor, unimaginative and predictable storylines... a couple of stories were alright, but by the time I finished the book I'd forgotten about them; the 20th and 21st are just dreadful. Skip this one."" RE at Breeze's Metro Club Review: I had been looking for this CD for a number of years. I have the album version and I love it. I thought that the CD could have had a little more bass added, but it is still one of my favorite RE outings. The entire recording is a throw back to the late 1980's when I was a teenager and enjoying Rare Essence. Wonderful CD!!" tons of information: Open this book and go on a journey across the world in search on the most Dangerous Creatures. The book has 3 chapters. Chapter One is Tooth and Claw. Here we learn about predators who use their teeth and claws such as bears and sharks. Chapter 2 " Not classical music, but I like it: First, what this is not: Its not ""classical music"", no symphony, no string quartet. Nope, its just Mr. Adams and his trusty bank of synths. It also is not ""rock"" or ""jazz"" or any other handy term. It is closest to the experimental music of Brian Eno (think Before and After Science without the singing) or the ""fusion/jazz"" compositions of Pat Metheny post 1990 (especially Imaginary Day).Some pieces I think are a lot of fun to listen to (Tourist Song, Cerulean, Coast). Other pieces I found really hard to listen to and undestand but I've found that over the years, I've learned to appreciate them, even the very odd music of Disappointment Lake and Bump (yikes!).This record suggests what Mr. Adams might accomplish were he to turn his attention more seriously towards ""popular"" music. I, for one, like this music better than ""Gnarly Buttons"" (for example)."" Excellent product and service: I use these types of bags for traveling by motorcycle, which means I need everything compact and waterpoof. These bags really held their seal well on my latest trip, and they are pretty sturdy. Also, the company was excellent to deal with when I asked for assistance."" A Great Product! Lots of Fun.: My almost-3-year-old son loves puzzles and loves fish, so this one was a no-brainer. I am impressed with the game's quality. And with a little imagination, it offers lots of educational fun: counting, colors, size comparisons, etc. I found a taller cardboard box and put the pieces magnet-up inside, then sent my son fishing for them. He thought the suprise of which on he'd get was great fun. After catching each, he would decide whether to ""throw 'em back"" (put back in the puzzle board or in the box) or ""cook 'em""!"" *sigh*: Well, it was Halloween so I thought I'd give this flick another chance. I thought another viewing might help me to change my mind about it but alas, sorry no. I give this movie 2 " echhhh: Please!!! don't buy this-I did and sold it back 2 " WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???: This is a bad film, The acting was terrible, the scares were not scary and Laurie Strode dies. To have payed more respect to ""Jamie Lee"" they should of let her die in a good film with a good script that was scary. I was really disappionted with this film but i had a feeling it would be bad before i watched it. The plot is about a money making producer played by Buster Rhymes (big mistake) who puts a bunch of college students into the Myers house on halloween to investigate on why Michael Myers went insane, while their being broadcasting live on the internet. Natrually Michael decides to join them and kills them off one by one. This film was predictable through out and left no impression on me at all, I could have pulled something better out of my nose, which says it all. See this film if your a big fan of the series but if your not I wouldn't waste my time!" What the %#@$ is this?!?!?!: All I have to say is that Busta Rhymes (main character) attached Michael Myers with Kung Fu and made the Bruce Lee sound while doing it... Thats worth at least -4 stars! Just look at the cover of the movie people! CRAP!" The worst Halloween movie of the whole series: The Halloween movies from the first to last just seems to get worse everytime a new one is released. The first two Halloween movies released ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween 2"" were the best of the whole series. They may even be my favorite movies of all time.Halloween Resurrection was just much different then the other Halloween movies. The movie was plain dumb. It had a horrible story line. The movie just gets more boring and boring the longer you watch it. I recommend that if you haven't seen any of the other Halloween movies you should watch them and leave this movie for the last to see." let's let this series die in piece before anymore of these sequels hurt the memory of the first and greatest halloween of all: jamie lee curtis at last has said goodbye to this series and not a moment to late. just not anything here that you haven't seen before and better. just a waste of time and our money. skip it." I Am Deeply Dissapointed: All i have to ask is what happened? This movie trilogy has been really good. This is really the only one that got me really dissapointed besides Halloween 5. First i think they have got a bad cast line up. My opinion i dont think Busta Rhymes was right for halloween. The story for this one is simple Michael Myers returns to his house while a live webcating base is filming their and Michael gets a little knife happy. Im not saying this whole movie is bad i liked it, but i was dissapointed in it. By my opinion the first ten minutes is good the rest are kind of bad. I think this movie was worth to check out at movies or rent at video store but it isnt worth buying. I said this before and i will say it again i think they should've stopped at H20."" Good Comeback!!!!: Had Its Moments! Mostley made up for H20. After The CrapFest that H20 was, This was a good attempt. Hopefully Rob Zombie does a Great Job on his Version."" A great ride from the first moment!: I had to travel one town over to see the movie when it opened today and it was well worth my time! From the moment it started, the action barely let up. I had made predictions on the plot before going in and it had enough twists in it to make sure I got quite a few of my ideas wrong, which is a wonderful suprise in a movie series that many say has outlived itself. The acting was above average on the whole and Bianca Kajlich was wonderful! I'll go out on a limb and say that she did a better job as a heroine in a horror movie than anyone since Jamie Lee Curtis. I'm looking forward to seeing her career take off like a rocket after this one! The script was good, the movie was well-made, there were plenty of surprises and squeal inducing moments and I'd go see it again in a heartbeat."" Poor, poor Michael: To take such an inspirational character like Michael Myers drag him into such miserable, no shame, waste-of-a-film should be a crime. What the heck is Busta Rhymes and Tyra doing in this film!??? You don't see Michael trying to sing or modeling a dress, do you? What's worse is that they try to jump on the whole Blair Witch reality TV garbage. At least Freddy and Jason have enough integrity to slash any flashy wanna be actor celebrities. Save your money." H20 should have been the final Halloween: Money and greed were the only rationale for making this film. Halloween H20 was a great way to close the series. Salutes and tributes to horror were all over the film with scenes referencing scenes from the original film (the sightings out the window in the middle of class) to icon cameos (Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis's mother/Psycho star) and the return of I&II;'s chain smoking nurse) to an opening tribute to Donald Pleasance via a voice over of classic lines from Halloween I.This movie had none of that and it sucked." Is He Dead This Time????: Ever since the very first Halloween movie, I have been hooked on this series. I have to admit, the only ones that I own are the ones with Jamie Lee Curtis in them, mainly because it's a continuation of the original. I honestly didn't expect much out of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be pretty good, and I don't think you will be disappointed in this movie, either." Great book. Great visionary.: Kiefer is one of the most easily recognized contemporary artists. This book is what I would call the definitive collection. Awesome value to anyone who follows the artist." GOOD LADY MUSIC: GREAT MUSIC FROM A ONE OF THE BEST COMPOSERS OF THE XX CENTURY ALONG WITH BURT BACHARCH, BRIAN WILSON AND PAUL MCcARTNEY."" BEWARE OF THE US DVD VERSION!!: I bought this DVD today, and I am very disappointed. On the package it advertises special features: audio commentary by the director, a special enactment of the script shot in Korea, and a music video for the song ""Ode to An Artist"". None of these things are actually on the DVD. It is misleading, if not downright fraudulent, and I am going to demand a refund."" Book Review: Having just visited the small town in South Alabama which was the setting for this book, it was a ""warm and fuzzy"" read! Very Southern and very sweet."" I Couldn't Sleep Until I Finished It!: I have to say this is one of the best books I've read in AGES! I laughed, I cried & enjoyed every page. This is such a heartwarming story & not just for the holidays. Oswald, Patsy, Jack & the folks of 'Lost River' will charm you any day of the year. I highly recommend this book for gift-giving or to treat yourself, you won't be disappointed!"" Turd Uk'n: Tried the Turducken this year. I was very disappointed. The bird doesn't stay together like the photos you see. After it's cooked, you don't know to slice or scoop out the bird. There was very little turkey meat on the outside and the inside had more rice than duck or sausage. Plus, it was dry. There were no juices when I cooked it. Luckily, we also cooked a traditional turkey which fed everyone. After all said and done, after $110, the Turducken was stuffing. I will never buy again."" nice price on a better mouthpiece.: This seemed to be a better mouthpiece than the one that came with my tenor when I bought it new. I had been a first chair band member in school, but I took about 15 years off before I decided to play again. I enjoy playing more with this item on the sax."" difficult to use: I am an appraiser and use desk calculators beside my pc keyboard. I have been using TI calculators for many years, but this one is not very good IMO. The buttons are not sensitive (no feedback), one must press firmly and look and the display to make sure the numbers entered are correct. Even when pressing firmly, frequently the numbers do not register. The memory (+, -) functions are also non responsive - there is no indication (feeback) the numbers have been recognized/entered. Other units I have used at least blink each time the M+ or M- buttons are pressed. Recently, I have had better luck with Casios and will give one a try."" Great for light accounting: The numbers are easy to read and big, but there is an optimal viewing angle outside of which the numbers are slightly faded. So, numbers appear their darkest when viewed from over ~5 degrees below the tilted screen's surface normal (the line that is perpendicular to the display's surface plane in 3D space). When placed on a desk, viewing is well within the optimal viewing angle, and I am quite pleased. The buttons are accommodating to rapid sequential pressing."" Calculator on the desk: Very good size to have on the desk to do a quick calculation. I use it for grading. Simple, light and effective. Serves its purpose."" Good while it lasts: I like the idea that I don't have to keep fussing with the timer setting as the seasons change. On the plus side, it works flawlessly, but only for about two years, then it dies catastrophically. My second one in just over 4 years just suddenly failed. At $15 a pop it's just not worth it. I'm going to find a new solution."" Awsome pictures!: You get what you pay for, great for outdoors pictures using the UV filter great color effects, and also indoors using the FL filter. A bargain for the price."" Railway Children - flash in the pan: ""Every beat of the heart"" is probably the only track that's good in this album. The rest are just mind-numbing repetitions of the same beat and ensemble of instruments. Don't waste your money on this album, just my personal 2 "" Implosion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I love Tilia's products but the older models Implode after age!I have tried to contact Tilia's web page, but I never get on line!Like I said, I love Tilia products but when they explode in my hand I have a problem with that.I whould like Tilia to at least respond to this matter!Dave Culp"" Thumbs up for Margaret Rutherford, thumbs down on everything else.: Although it is a pleasure watching Margaret Rutherford steal every scene she is in (not hard, given that the supporting players in this movie are all grade B performers), this is not a very good film...much less a good story. There are too many convenient elements that occur, too many convoluted plot and character threads, too many red herrings, and no real reason to care who did it or why. This is one of those mysteries where the viewer is not given enough information to figure it out along with the protagonist, and as a result I felt manipulated. Not recommended unless you are a big fan of Margaret Rutherford." Great Product!: Great product! would recommend to put into your car as a part of your safety/survival kit. I love it! Get one" Torture: So I thought I'd give this another listen, just to see if it was as bad as I thought it was originally.Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was orignally.IT WAS EVEN WORSE!!Patinkin's ghastly braying is the foulest noise yet to assault the human ear. He makes gangsta rap sound downright soothing. I will never listen to this crap again."" very good for the price: This is soft and perfect for dogs that like to burrow in cold weather, plus the price is very low."" Unhappy: I thought this was a Electronic Organizer, but it turned out to be a Momo Master Alarm...........I kept and have been able to use it although difficult for my use.The product is fine........just not what I expected or wanted" Key German Memoir: 'With the German Guns' is the English version of a book originally published in German. It has the major strength that few other memoirs by German soldiers of the period are availiable in English. It contains fascinating passages describing bombardments (from the perspective of those doing the shooting !) Its coverage may be criticised as uneven - but then as an accurate memoir of real war service this is almost inevitable. A 'top twenty' book for anyone interested in WW1 " Great Period 70's Look- Or Shoddy film making?: The trailer for this film is on IMDB.The film was shot nearby my home in Schenectady NY.There was no budget for this, they asked extras to bring their own original 70's clothes and hired people who had them.It by-passed theaters and is going straight to DVD and the Lifetime movie network...The shoddy work seen in the trailer makes it look like it was actually shot on Super 8 film in the 70's.." You're My Little Love Bug (Parent Love Letters): This is the second time we have purchased this book-the first book wore out and also the replacement batteries. My two year old granddaughter sings the whole book as did the 6 year old when she was two." Love it!: This book is absolutely adorable. I purchased it for my 6 month old daughter and she is just enthralled with the lights and the music. Granted, my son wouldn't have been interested at her age (he never went in for books or music at her age), but my daughter loves it. You know your child best, so you should have a good idea of whether or not they'll like the lights and sounds.I do wish there was a volume control so we could turn it down at sleepy time, but even without it, I can highly recommend the book."" Fun, but the original still better: People refer to the ""piano"" version as if Bach wrote this for the piano, rather than the harpsichord. This string version is very nicely done, but it loses the crispness and velocity of attack that is only possible with a solo instrument, whether in the original harpsichord or piano version. It gains something in sonority and the mellowness of the string sound. But in the end, Bach wrote this for a keyboard instrument, and to suggest that the piece would sound equally good in an orchestra transcription would imply that Bach was not really thinking about what he was doing in the first place, when he wrote it for the harpsichord. No, he was taking full advantage of the potentiality in the harpsichord. And while a piano transcription deviates from that, it is still a solo keyboard.This string version is a nice one to add to one's Bach library, but it will never replace either the harpsichord or piano versions."" Masterpiece: Blaze have proven once again that they are truely the current Godfathers of vocal /soulful house music.Inspirers and pioneers of the soulful ""Shelter"" sound. I personally rate them as the best house producers currently, followed by the likes of Frankie Feliciano, Dj Spinna and Osunlade.It would be a great tragedy for any music lover to not have this CD in their collection.The CD has a lot of meaning and is extremely inspiring and uplifting.I cannot forsee how Blaze can outdo what they have produced in this Album.But then again Blaze are Blaze, true legends in terms of soulful house and one thing they have done consistently without fail to outdo themselves."" Great debut for short-lived band.: A West Coast gem of a band.The Origin's radio-friendly ""alternative""/pop/acoustic rock sound made their self-titled debut album so sweet and catchy.Some very well written music and lyrics with some occassionally over-produced tracks, this album is innocent and hopeful and also sad at times without being corny.Oddly enough, had they got the proper exposure they would've been a lot more successful in both the ""alternative"" college radio scene and Top 40 / MTV.It's a damn shame that they only put out one another great album after this. It's just as good but with a more psychedelic sound to it as the trend dictacted at the time.Buy it and enjoy!"" Fantastic Georgia rock and roll: Guadalcanal Diary was one of the best live bands in the late 1980's. They came out of the Georgia jangle-rock explosion rocking heavier than REM (and shunned comparison to that band). In this package, you have their first two albums, Walking In the Shadow of the Big Man (previously available on CD) and Jamboree (previously NOT available on CD). Both are great examples of the raw energy Guadalcanal brought to the clubs on the college circuit. I can't exactly decide who they compare with. I've heard Los Lobos songs that remind me of GD, but the best I can think of is a high-energy Bo Diddly-lost-in-the-jungle kind of rock and roll.I've personally been waiting well over a decade for their material to surface again and gave up all hope of Elektra realizing what a goldmine they were sitting on with the GD catalogue. Now, if 2x4 (with bonus cut) and Flip Flop are re-released, I'll be a happy camper!" Disappointed: I expected to receive a good quality throw. It is quite thin and cheap looking. It certainly is not worth the price." MISLEADING: This item is listed as a 6-Pack, when in fact it is a SINGLE light bulb. When I contacted the vendor their response was that AMAZON mislabeled the item."" Nikon Action 7x35: I wanted a pair of binoculars with a wide viewing area and good optics, these fit the bill. They are a little larger and a little heavier than I wanted and if you want to pay hundreds of dollars more for a smaller, higher quality product, they're out there. But I looked at low priced, smaller binoculars and there's really no comparison in quality, the ""Nikon Action 7x35"" are the best value for the price. A good place to compare in person is ""Outdoor World"", they have a great selection. Just my 2 " Great Puppet: I bought this puppet as a gift for the sister of the ringbearer in our weddding. She LOVED it and it kept her very busy during the rehearsal dinner. Very cute puppet - much cuter than ones I've seen at Toys R Us and for a much lower price. The details like the little tufts and tongue are just adorable." Don't know much about 50 states: I have read and reviewed many children's books in my 28 years as an elementary school librarian, and have found none with more glaringly inaccurate and unclear writing:Washington is the Evergreen State, not the ""CHINOOK State"", Mt.St. Helens did not have ""LAVA"" flows as the text says it did, the section about the state says that the Chinook winds are a ""PAIR of winds"" and does not explain what they are, they are warm winds that sometimes flow from east to west bringing warm air west. As a native of Washington, I began, and ended, reading in the section on our state. After reading the section I did not bother to check to see if the other states information was as inaccurate and poorly written, as I knew that I certainly would not want this book in any library nor in the hands of any children, dispite the vissual appeal."" Full of trivia kid's will find fun to learn!: My 8.5 year old LOVES this book. I actually learned several facts I wasn't aware of. (Alaska is closer to Russia than it is to the rest of the United States for instance.) This book is no encyclopedia, but it's A LOT more fun to read than one!"" Sitt Marie-Rose is an AWFUL book!: I did not enjoy this book whatsoever. I was terrible. DO NOT waste your money on it!! Reading this book was a waste of time. I'm neither a Christian nor Palestinian; I'm not saying this book was awful because I was offended by it (as some might be). Very objectively, I judge that this is poor, horrible, boring literature...A waste of time and money. If I could I would not give it a star at all. One star is more than it deserves!"" Wonderful characters; great writing: It's long, at times it's tedious, but it is a book that remains with you long after the last page. The characters of both Oscar and Lucinda are so well drawn and their interaction is told with such tension that it is painful but with generous splashes of humor that just sparkles. I agree with some of the reviewers who feel the ending somewhat loses steam, but that is very minor. Great writing. If you enjoy a historical love story set in a far away land involving two people who are far from ordinary, try ""Oscar and Lucinda."""" Don't buy a Magnavox: ... I have this TV/VCR combo and it is horrible. The pictureis great, and the size is great but it does not work. In the timethat I have had it, it has completely stopped working three times and Philips Magnavox will not take responsibility for defective merchandise! Save your money and buy a better product! END"" Cut and paste: This book looks like a Project Gutenberg eBook printed in book form, complete with the lack of proper page breaks, line spacing, and common symbols, like dashes. Imagine reading a page full tightly-packed text with every third or fourth sentence ending in an '' (the book's symbol for a dash), and you can understand what a chore reading Skues has become for me. Spend an extra ten or twelve dollars more and buy a fourth edition instead, color-illustrated and hardcover."" worked for a short time and stopped: I also had problems with the machine, After a couple of months of using it when I walk, the player stopped recognizing that there was a disc in the player and if I can get the player to see a disc I get static on it. I am also very disapointed."" A mixture of linguistics & history: This book tells the story of Italy, with emphasis on the languages spoken there. I don't like it so much because I was looking for something that is more a treatment of the development of Romance, with special attention to the hows & whys of the various languages & dialects that evolved in Italy."" Would return this. . .: . . . if I'd been smart enough to retain my receipt. My TomTom doesn't fit in this, so it's absolutely, 100% useless! I thought it was just the placement in my vehicle that was making it difficult to mount the TomTom, but when I removed the mount from the window & tried to insert the TomTom, I found that the grooves in the mount are slightly closer together than the ridges in the TomTom. Useless, completely useless! I do, of course, have the extra charger, but maybe that doens't fit either; I haven't the heart to try it." TomTom Additional Mount Review: The product is fine but a little overpriced in my opinion! The shipping was efficient and it arrived in great condition. I think the price is driven by TOMTOM not this seller." Does not fit 2008 Nissan Frontier: States that it fits 2008 Nissan Frontier but it does not, install attempt as per instruction, yet posterior hole of step is 4 inches too far rearward. Returned item and charged for return shipping. How is it that Amazon claims that it this matter not their error. I will no longer order items that Amazon claims it fits or is compatible with existing or specific types of vehicles."" Horrible!!: This wig is so bad!! It looks nothing like the picture, and the hair isn't even long enough to make it look like the picture.The wig is so small it does not even fit over my head (which is quite average). Of course it can't be returned because it is a wig.I lost money on this wig, 'cause it went in the trash. Buy this one, and you will be sorry!!"" Delivers as promised!: I love my Foodsaver product. I use it all the time and it keeps food really fresh for a longer period of time. After opening cheeses, I would have to use them within the week or cut away the unwanted parts. Now I just use my Foodsaver with the special bags and cheese seems to last forever! Really great product. I just hope the motor doesn't burn out with the use I'm getting out of it!"" great deal: I bought it on sale for only 18 dollars. fit perfectly. great for a long walk , very comfy."" Pretty Lame: This book received such good reviews that I ordered it for my first-grader, thinking it would certainly be a winner. I sent it back without giving it to him, however, because I found the riddles to be VERY lame. I give it 2 "" A Crossover To Embrace: Dawn Upshaw is one of those few classical singers who can do crossover work and shine brilliantly. I am a major lover of Steve Sondheim, and she does wonderous things with some of his lovely songs. If you are lover of well sung Musical Comedy music, be sure you put this terrific CD on your list."" The Night Listener will hear you snoring!: The night listener will hear you snoring. It will because this film will put you to sleep. Robin Williams is a great actor but not even he could save this film. Some of the story has bite in the mystery and suspense department, but the department soon gets shut down. Some of the characters are so unbelievable that it really takes away from a story that had promise. I rented this movie and I did not buy it. I do not feel it has any value as a must own for future viewings. It would not even do good collecting dust in your DVD collection. There are much better, more qualified films out there when it comes to keeping dark suspense around every corner, instead of zig zagging like supernatural shadows with no direction. It might be that this film is enjoyed more by those who liked the book it was taken from."" Smell-good oils, not essential oils: The gardenia and lilac smell ok. These are not powerful pure essential oils though. They are just kinda nice smelling oils."" One of Two Masterpieces: Most composers are lucky to have one masterpiece; Philip Glass has the good fortune to have two: ""Music in Twelve Parts"" and ""Einstein on the Beach."""" power house: This is a fantastic rod if you are use to casting department store rods and you cast this amazing piece of equipment you will be pleaseantly suprised at the ease at which you can acuratlly throw your line, it takes almost no effert to hit your mark and this unit really roll casts extremely well, this is a no frills rod it is all about performance and that is what you want if you are going to catch fish, I forgot to mention the price it is not cheap just inexpensive! This rod is a genuine bargain, this rod will cast just as well as any of the $300-$400 fly rods it is light and feels very smooth and powerful when you cast it, it is a real keeper in my book."" Awesome Strainer: The handle on our old plastic strainer broke and we searched for a replacement in various stores with no luck. When I found this pot strainer, I knew it would be perfect. Delivery was fast and my husband is thrilled." Food Saver Rolls.: I have not used it yet. It looks pretty good except it is thinner than the original that came with the seal-a-meal. I will send another review after I use it. Lucy Cyllinan" Needs to be reworked.: This is not the best written book. I am learning a lot of stuff about FrontPage 2002, but I while reading the book I get the filling that it was by more than one person. Sometimes the 1st person is used, sometimes it is not. The steps in the books are not always clear and are overly wordy. Some of the steps seem to over explain process that had already be explain earlier, almost as if the author did not realize he had already explain them. You can learn with this book, but unless you're buying it at a very discounted price, by some other book."" DARNED GOOD: Good songs, different vocalists, demo's with new guy, nice mix. Interesting booklet, the history of Zao. 60 minutes of pure clean christian hardcore, metalcore, whatever, heavy metal? Okay. Support Zao, buy their cds, they are amazing!"" Amazing.: As a World War II historian, I have to say this is a beautiful dramatization of the Wannsee Conference. It's based on a real event, but clearly dramatized. Worth a look or five if you're interested in the period, though. It will hold a very worthy place on my wall of movies." Chilling history aptly shown.: This dramatisation of the Wannsee Conference and what materialised from it is truly riveting. The personages of Reinhard Heydrich and Adolf Eichmann were well presented in this film and provides a good look into the character of the two men who defined 'The Final Solution'." Neither fact nor fiction: Let's begin with the positives: the acting is superb, and the costumes and sets are surprisingly accurate (note the bronze swastika-emblazoned napkin holders being polished in the opening scene.) Now the negatives: as a film, it drags. It is the story of a meeting of bureaucrats; how could it not? As history, it is largely speculative. The minutes of this infamous conference, from the ""one surviving copy"", are barely 8 1/2 " Genealogy: This book was very helpful in giving me names of early residents of Pulaski Co. Ga. I was able to find my GGGGGrandfather's name on the 1809 Petit Juror list which gave me more evidence that he was living there at the time. There may have been other ways to find this but I like having the book because it is helpful to see other surnames that are important to our research and it is a handy reference." Extremly Poor Product: I have now owned 3 Professional II machines, one of which was repaired under warranty. All have failed with light to moderate use! All 3 ultimately failed to vacuum. I would have voted zero stars but that was not an option!"" Overbearing and dreary...: I'm disappointed to report that the first major Steve Reich work to appear in quite some time is a total drag. I hope his music doesn't continue down this dead-end path. The rhythmic and harmonic freshness and appeal heard in such brilliant and varied pieces as Different Trains, Music for 18 Musicians, Octet, and The Desert Music is distilled here into short episodes of watered-down Reich-isms. The spoken samples that were so seamlessly interwoven into Different Trains just sort of sit there in The Cave. And the socio-spiritual elements are totally overbearing, dragging the music down further. Steve Reich has always been one of my favorite composers...I hope he finds a way to develop his unique style more successfully in future projects. It's somewhat disturbing that the most interesting Steve Reich release in the past 10 years was all remixes by other artists. I think he should re-focus on the music and avoid musical-theatre concepts like ""The Cave""." Where did my time go?: This is 2  Not much to say that hasn't been said....: If ya ain't seen it....watch it.....if ya have seen it...wooo! you and 10 zillion others. Classic. not bad for a 3 hour movie: i have never seen a movie with diane keaton so young but she has grown into a beautiful woman. she looks better now then she did in this movie. the movie is really long but it is well worth it. i loved the end of the movie when she looks over. and i can't wait to see the rest" As with GodFather 2, 2 "" Great Movie! Crappy DVD!: I love this movie.But I hate Paramount for treating such a classic this way. This editon of THE GODFATHER is one of the poorest transfers to DVD that I've ever seen. Light and color levels fluctuate like a bad 60s acid flashback. Trash and dirt specks fly through several scenes like swarms of insects.There's a Coppola commentary, but no other extras. And I can live without too many extra features, as long as the movie itself has been remastered with respect not only for its artistic merit, but also for its intended audience.Do NOT buy this DVD, unless you're willing to view the movie as it would be seen through a tank of murky water. This is an insult to every fan of this movie, and Paramount should be very, very ashamed."" One of the greatest films of all time. If you haven't seen it, see it!: There are very very few films in this world that are of such high quality in so many categories as this one. The cast is fantastic, the acting is great, the story draws you right in, cinematography and directing are top notch. And let's not forget the music, which stays with you long after the film is over. Truly a masterpiece, The Godfather is also a solid piece of entertainment. It will grip you from start to finish. It touches on so many themes in such a deep way, you're left with a million threads to explore. I've seen this film many many times and am always up to see it again. There's always some new nuance I notice, some little detail that slipped by or I didn't fully appreciate the first time. Scene after memorable scene flows by, leaving you in a perpetual state of amazement. Get this film and you will see the heights the filmic medium can reach."" Superb!: This movie is one of the very very best ever made. Its only shortcoming is that it glorifies organized crime. Still, it's a movie nobody should miss."" staggering intensity: This isn't so much a review as a story - I loaned my copy of this cd to a co-worker, a very optimistic and sunny type (on the back of a tape that I actually thought he'd be interested in), and told him that when I really got depressed I'd put this on full volume and blast all the ugliness out of my head. He returned the tape, and told me he kinda liked the other side, but regarding Black Sheets of Rain he looked at me with a worried expression and said ""I never get that depressed"". That may tell you whether you want to buy this."" Prelude to Copper blue: Let's get something straight. This and and workbook came long before Sugar and Bob's post sugar work. That said, this is a brilliant shot across the bow. Sugar far more sounds like this than Hubcab and the Dog and Pong show....and now there is a new album, which I don't know the name of or have heard, yet. If you loved Husker Du or Sugar, this is a must to own."" articulately ugly: This music well expresses ugliness.The word 'psychotic', seems to suit the sound of many of the tracks.There is no denying that most people would dislike the severity of this cd.The chaos is applied, however, with great detail (using chorus as the main, with countless traditional + classical instruments).'Atonal' is the classical term for the absense of key signature - The notes are all over place.The singing is especially akward sounding.The links this music has to Russian folklore are very confusing, but well explained in the (excellent) liner notes.This music's sound though, is like 20th century Russian classical."" This is an old edition: WARNING -- WARNING -- WARNINGDelorme published a 5th edition in 2003. This edition (4th edition) is an older one. If you want the most currecnt edition you will need to look else where. This edition is copywright 2000 with information that appears to be accurate to 1999. New roads, etc not on this edition.Although it will probably be acceptable for many uses, just make certain that you are willing to buy the older edition."" Stinky wipes: I bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad."" Good for sensitive skin.: These wipes have quite a scent to them, but they work well. My son is extremely fair and breaks out when he gets ketchup on his face. These are very effective and prevent breakouts. Most Mustela products have worked wonders for us since my son was born. We still use them and he's three."" Thriller Checklist: Plot -- Formulaic and improbable, a page turner nonetheless. In fact, I felt like I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.Writing -- Copy and paste at it's best, all flights are delayed by an hour, and all characters like soda pop.Editing -- No editing in evidence. This novel reads like a rough draft re-typed overnight after drinking and before an early morning deadline -- re-typed and never re-read before going to press."" DO NOT buy/read this GARBAGE: I honestly don't know how this book has some five star reviews, definitely the author writes these pathetic and untruthful reviews. This book is poorly written, I can't believe it was even published!!! What a waste of time and money!!!! I assure you, you will stop reading after twenty pages, the paper of this book would be better used for craft projects or for picking up your pet's waste.I was curious to know more about who could write something this bad and I found out more than I anticipated about the ""writer"" please copy and paste this on your web browser and then decide for yourself if it's worthy to give this guy a penny out of your pocket...[...]This man and this book are both sad and disappointing!"" THIS TOY COST WAY TOO MUCH.: This was my first purchase from amazon and I must say that although it got here as promised, the quality of the product was not worth the $[...] , s/h fee and $[...] express delivery fee. My son was happy to get what he wanted but this toy should have cost [...] the most. Yes, that would include shipping handling and express delivery service."" Finally, real help for a real epidemic!: It's obvious Dr. Mintle really knows her material. Tragically this is one topic no parent or teacher can afford to ignore. It seems like many heads are hidden in proverbial sand these days. Maybe once school starts up again this book will be hard to find. Glad I got mine now!"" GREAT GIFT: FOR THE BEGINNER THIS IS A GOOD TOOL TO TEACH AND TO LEARN MOST OF THE MOVES , JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR" Chess Teacher Review: I like everything about this product. It gives the experienced player more patience with the less experienced. Although I do have to comment on the incorrect picture on the box! Follow the enclosed instructions and you'll do great!" Love or Hate: As previous costumers have either loved it or hate it philosophy, toward this game, one must realize that the manufacture describes the minimum and the recommended system to run this particular software is preformance, I would lean toward more the higher end, than the lower, even though some people may that the same enjoyment. Also I would place or install it on a partition that different than my OS was operating on; meaning ""D:/"" or etc. This could prevent some problems which other have had previously mentioned. Other that being a zombie isn't that bad only thing that there is no score or reward for eating the victim's brains or beating them senseless. It's a B-movie theme and hold to true with the ""B"" meaning BAD, either in a good perspective or actually bad. Enjoy."" ONE STAR TOO MANY: You pay your money. You take your chances. If it runs on your computer consider yourself lucky. If it doesn't, don't say you weren't warned.

Very happy!" Poorly made: My daughter wanted a unicorn for Christmas so I bought this one. I have sewn up twice since we opened it (3 days ago). If my daughter wasn't in love with it I'd send it back. Stuffed animals should be durable enough for a five year old. Perfect for your Little Princess: My daughter LOVES her Sparkle! The unicorn is made of very soft material and its feet are gold just like the horn! The little pink purse is very soft too and just adds the perfect flair!

Recomendo" The Gathering Storm: A very good accountng of the between the wars years of Winston Churchill. Churchill fans should enjoy this film a great deal and I hope to use it in my World History classroom to bring up the level of interest in this great man." Wonderful (Most accurate portrait shows positive and negative aspects of the man): Came away impressed, shows the favorable and unfavorable of the man equally well showing characteristics of biographers on the left (Roy Jenkins) and Right (Manchester)Worth seeing as so many portrayals don't give you a sense of the main characteristics of the man he is either entirely heroic or (rarely if at all entirely negative). But at the same time those seeking something either entirely favorable or entirely negative will be disappointed as the story seeks to be even.Mr Finney is exceptional and truly earns his Emmy other leads like Ms. Redgrave, Mr. Jacobi, are also quite good."" ""Hands across the pond, Sir!"" Smashingly delightful.: Sir Churchhill continues to be denied his fulll measure in history, but this movie helps us understand him better. After all, even the British can be human. The Free World owes very much to this Great Leader, who warned us all of the ""Iron Curtain"" that continues in a different form even today. God Love you, Winnie."" DIRTY ""Little Black Book"": I rented this DVD to watch with my 2 " Not the ultimate guide: I enjoyed watching this DVD but for being a student and beginner this DVD was not for beginners but more to enhance already learned skills.

You want the original Chess recordings, so it needs to be something on MCA (which purchased the Chess catalog years ago). Here are your choices:1) 20 Century Masters (2000) - 12 "" Good read even for a non-Trekkie.: This is one of my favorite Star Trek books(and I've read well over a hundred of them)!For a Trekkie,this book would be an insight into Uhura,and into the friendship and life of the Enterprize crew.But a non-Trekkie would enjoy it too - although the humor of the crew interactions - Spock,McCoy,Evan - would be missed.I enjoyed reading about both planets of cat-like beings and their cultures,and understanding the Star Trek humor made it even more enjoyable.This book is not the usual fighting or intrigue - just songs and friendship and search for a cure - and evaluating the process of growing up in the process.A good book to read and reread!"" ""Mary Sue"" hits space...: The most egregious ""Mary Sue"" Trek book on record, ""Uhura's Song"" presages some of the more extravagant fan-fiction missives by putting the author, the late Janet Kagan, into the narrative as the puckish Dr. Evan Wilson. Wilson dominates the story, solving every crisis, somehow knowing the solution to every dilemma, and generally leading the entire Trek crew around by the nose. Uhura's character, ostensibly the book's subject, is reduced even further to a bit player in the drama.The plot is basically straight out of the mind of a shut-in cat person - a race of noble, intelligent felines attempt to overcome an AIDS-type epidemic by connecting to their long-lost cousins, a primitive yet honorable society of talking meowers.Kagan wasn't devoid of writing skill - her Hugo Award wins certainly indicate otherwise - but this novel definitely does not represent her as anything other than a glorified Star Trek fan-fiction author. Disappointing..."" Not just another Trek novel!: Uhura's Song was the first Star Trek novel I ever read, and almost every one since has been a disappointment. Some Trek novels can be formulaic with plots that are painfully predictable. But Uhura's Song is so much more! The alien cultures are wonderfully developed, and the original characters are delightful. If the book lacks a bit as far as technical precision goes (the portrayal of the universal translator is different here than in other Trek works, and I wonder how such a thing could exist), the author more than makes up for it by giving us characters and cultures that will not easily be forgotten.I read this book for the first time about sixteen years ago. It's the type of book that you can just randomly open to a page and start reading. Definitely my favorite of the Trek novels." Great movie: The DVD came quickly and in good shape. This movie is a classic sci-fi and highly recommended to anyone that hasn't seen it! Great adaptation of the Crichton novel." No help in understanding concepts: If your looking for a linear algebra textbook that only has problems and a few proofs and theorems mixed in, this is for you. Otherwise look elsewhere. As a student taking linear algebra/dif.eq. for physics, I've found this text dry and absulutley unhelpfull. Maybe it's good practice for further math classes by math majors, but for someone like myself it is near impossible to get any long lasting skills from a text that is so dry. Also, if you expect to get anything from this book without the help of a proffesor or TA explaining it, good luck."" Nice for around the office: I use this calculator on a daily basis around my office. Here are a few reasons while I really like it:1. The LCD number display is large and very clear.2. The ergonomic shape makes is easy to get a nice firm grip along the side.3. It is very sturdy. This has been knocked off the desk more than a few times, and it has kept on ticking.4. The buttons are well-spaced and accurate. I very rarely make any entry errors." intoxicating!: It's such an addicting movie. I have watched it many times and I enjoy it more each time I watch it. I love the saturated colors and sexy music they used in the film. They are like these strong feelings that the characters never dared to share with each other throughout the movie. It's the best foreign movie ever!" Disappointing: The movie seemed to be based on the fear of each actor rather than any true intent to investigate an alleged ""haunted"" house. The psychic was very inexperienced and went sofar as to bring a Ouiji Board along. The character portraying Ryan felt qualified because she was a historian major? She was the most useless and annoying character of all the characters. The characters, Tim and Paul, were the most believable and their acting was convincing. (Too bad they weren't offered a script worthy of their talents.)Not much happened at all pertaining directly to activity expected to be seen in such an alleged spirited old house.I would not again pay to see this movie a second time. Nor would I recommend anyone else pay to see this movie.This movie may entertain a more novice horror buff. However, if you love a ""good"" (i.e. well-written/well-acted) horror movie, you will be disappointed in this one." Very funny! Very Scary! Very Silly!: Welcome to St. Francisville where four cute 20 somethings enter a haunted house for a night of scares and laughs. It isn't to be taken too seriuosly and doesn't always seem as real as the movie makers might want you to think it is. But it is frightning at times and funny the rest. Four stars from me! Awesome shoes: Have had these shoes for almost 4 years now and they are still going strong. Good deal REVISIT HER! YOU WON'T BE SORRY: I agree with the Californian - I thought she was wierd when I was young and now I think she's prolific and amazingly talented. Black Boys on Mopeds gives me chills. She's mature and you need to be mature to get it all. Thank God I am now." History culture and folklore: Margaret Visser takes typical components of an American meal (corn, salt, butter, chicken, rice, lettuce, olive oil, lemon juice, ice cream), and shows the reader what they tell us about our history and culture. It is one of the effects of mass production that we have very little idea how our products are produced, and for those people who share an interest for food, why people eat what they do, and the beliefs people hold about food, this book will be fascinating. It is not just a collection of tidbits of useless trivia; there is a steady theme of the food being discussed in each chapter. At the same time, it is not just about the particular foods she chooses as her chapter titles. With Visser, you find out that not only do our behaviors of consumption have far reaching effects that are largely unnoticed by the general public, but also that the foods we eat have long, unthinkable histories that determine our attitudes towards them." Best trap available online without spending tons of money: Best trap available online without gettign stupid crazy on price and shipping. solid heavy gauge metal doesn't even register dings with my Benjamin .22  Plink: Catches bullets like a Philadelphia cop.

The brownie recipes turn out like rubber and the cake and cookie recipes have twice the flour and half the sugar as normal recipes, resulting in dry, flavorless things. I keep trying new recipes hoping there will be a redeeming quality in this book, but I have yet to find one. Any dessert recipe by Isa Chandra Moskowitz has turned out delightfully. Or I just find a non vegan recipe and veganize it with similar ingredients.

They make reliable and durable products." Robbed: I received the calculator promptly. After 3 days the calculator stopped working and right in the middle of a test I was taking! Don't buy used scientific calculators. Just go to Walmart and buy a new one. It's not worth the couple of dollars you might save." A dissenting opinion on a terrible calculator: I bought two of these calculators and neither performs well - the buttons are terribly sensitive to the point that we often accidently enter the wrong numbers, so we have to pay extra attention. Further, my calculator is currently displaying entirely different numbers than I am putting in - perhaps the battery is dying, but I have no idea how long it may have been doing this. I will definitely be looking for a different calculator next time around."" horrible book: This book is a horrible book! I was trying to solve the mystery of her disappearance, reading through 167 dull pages with little story. She was not kidnapped, as I thought she was. It turns out she was just locked in a pantry.

Don't buy this horrible book!!!!" Great for skin and allergies: I own a 2 " This book made me relize that nature has it's own magik.: It made me look closer at things like the earth and it's plants.

Rik Emmett on his own is not good and this album is in fact very mediocre to say the least. Bought it, heard it, sold it..." Listen to the 1 " An essential Afropop choice: I am a big fan of Youssou N'Dour, and I think this is still his best CD. All of the songs are enjoyable; there are no ""throwaways"" on this one! The songs range from the quiet string-backed ""Xale,"" to the frenetic ""Alboury,"" and all of them serve up Youssou's soaring voice at its best. Most of the lyrics are in Wolof, but quite a few are in English, and are well done. My favorites include ""Set,"" ""Feenene,"" and especially, ""Toxiques.""One more great thing about this CD: it sounds great! If you have a good sound system, especially with great bass response (with a subwoofer for example,) you'll love the sound of this CD. In fact, I think its a great CD to bring with you when shopping for any level of sound system." great for my 4lb chihuahua: My 4 lb. Chihuahua loves this bed. She loves to sleep on top of it just as much as snuggled inside. I tucked a soft blanket under the top flap to make it even more appealing. Sometimes i can't even see her tucked inside of the bed!" Far above and beyond the usual vigilante thriller!: As others have already seen to it, I won't rehash the major plot points of the book. To summarize: Deputy U.S. Marshall Timothy Rackley loses his daughter then his job, prompting him to take extreme measures to see justice done. Your basic formula for almost any vigilante cop thriller, right?Not so. Not this time. Gregg Hurwitz takes a common premise and does some remarkable things with it. While there is at least one major plot twist that many readers will sniff out far in advance, the writing, the pacing, and the characterizations in this book are exceptional. It takes a certain talent to weave intense morality plays into all the equally intense action.Be warned, however, this is not light reading! The violence and brutality is conveyed with gut wrenching skill.The book grabs you early and does not let go. Highest recommendation." Something was overlooked!: Before making my purchase I read other customer reviews and decided this was a good choice. Was I the only one that did not appreciate the fact that my 12 " Knockout Berlioz: I picked up this magnificent CD at a dollar store. I guess that old saying ""you get what you paid for"" is not always true. One buck for a great CD is an astonishing bargain. The performances are simply wonderful, especially the playing of the Royal Philharmonic. Mackerras takes a very strange repeat in the fourth movement. I have never heard it before. If this was a bad performance, I would hate this repeat. But the performance is so entertaining, I simply enjoyed listening again. If you can find this CD, buy it. You will not regret it."" An Awesome "" Sing along out loud"" album: I LOVE every song on Covered and Uncovered. That's hard to find in most artist, but this combination brings about such a varity. ""Tonight"" makes you feel like really two-stepping in sync with someone,, even if you don't really love them!! And ""Figure It Out"" is the new married woman's anthem for time to herself.... COVERED gives me the time during my morning worship to really praise the LORD and say that I am thankful for everything. I sing OUT LOUD in my car on my commute, and I know other people think I am Crazy!!!!! These are two tremendous voices, together in Love with each other and above all, GOD. I can't wait to see what's next.. Maybe a Christmas album??????????? But you will NOT be disappointed with this one!!!!"" No chance in hell!: I spent $43 on Glee season one because I bought it in two volumes. I think season one cost $35 when it was finally released in its entirety. And now it is down to $15. I can't believe Amazon is pulling this again. I will wait for the full season two to be released, thank you very much."" Glee Season 2: Great show and this season, although not as magical as the last, is still a joy to own on DVD. Watching the episodes over and over is a lot of fun because the music is fantastic. Great to even put on the tv while doing other things and just listen to the music." It gets the job done.: Its not really the best capo by any means but for the price it works wonderfully. The only issue i have with this is that it has to be strapped around the neck instead of squeezing a handle and putting it where it needs to go. Excellent for playing around at home but not too good for doing shows." Good for kitchen use: This is a good item from which to hang small pots and pans (I use it on the side of my refrigerator), but the only concern is that if you drag it around it will mark the surface." Leaks and Company will not stand behind product: I had this product for 8 months (Professionally installed)... Part of a new kitchen.. I got the under sink kit and it leaks to the point it almost ruined my cabinet... I called the support line and they said I needed to buy a new one and the warranty was only good for 100 days which is just about enough time to realize the lack of quality in the craftsmanship..." Grows on you.: I purchased this because I was looking for some non-classical Dawn Upshaw, who always seems to have a lot of fun with the ""lighter"" stuff. After the first spin, I recognized ""Someone to Watch Over Me,' of course, along with ""Maybe"" and""Clap Yo Hands."" The rest did not make much of an impression.At first. After three listens, my head was full of catchy and well-delivered Gerschwin songs. Recommended to Upshaw fans, Gerschwin fans (both brothers), Broadway buffs, and anyone interested in the crazy 1920s."" Laughton Was A Master Story Teller: The great stage and screen actor, Charles Laughton, had a parallel career as a public reader and story teller -- one of the best of the 20th Century, as Dickens himself was in the 19th. ""Fabulous Country"" is a most wonderful collection of short writings on themes of American life which Laughton loved, praised, and publicly performed. It is a genius stature anthology, and a fabulous resource for today's actors and storytellers -- many of whom never knew the pre-war America. His other great book, equally useful and enjoyable, is called ""Tell Me A Story."" I was raised on Laughton's Bible readings, his many radio broadcasts and records. No one has come close to matching him in scope, breadth and depth of wisdom."" Worst. Movie. Ever.: Oh my god, this was terrible. Literally the worst thing I have ever seen. Every single review marking this movie as terrible is dead on. The leading lady makes Denise Richards look like she has depth. She makes Carrot Top seem like he could win an Oscar. And she makes the muppets look like they're articulate. The entire movie is dubbed, and to call it poorly done would be praising it. It's done so badly, that at one point I wondered if some freak accident happened to the reels and they were forced to dub sound over at the last minute on 5 dollars, on one take. Honestly, every person in this movie is terrible, including Bradley Cooper, which hurts me strictly because of Wet, Hot American Summer. Anyone that gave this review positive marks had to have been in it, and shameless."" Horrid.: I can't even believe Bradley Cooper would allow this to be released. Worst movie in ages, and i just had to stop it. Unwatchable. I rented it from a kiosk and wanted to shake the machine to refund the dollar i wasted....even though it was on my debit card.Terrible movie."" Should have known better to rent this: It took me 6 hours to download this movie and I only watched about six minutes of the whole movie. While I was downloading it, I went to IMDB and saw the horrible ratings and have to agree. Why was Bradly Cooper involved with this movie, he's so much better than this?"" It's way below one star: I am easily entertained, but this is the first movie in years that I didn't finish watching. Wish I had clicked it off when I first thought about it. As everyone else is saying it is just plain bad...bad...bad! Don't even rent it for a dollar. Don't even watch it for free. I couldn't belive how stilted and awful the acting was."" calc for chemistry students: the keys absolutely suck, they don't register right so when you try to do 2+2+2+2+2, it instead reads as 22+2+22, not a good calculator, i recommend getting the higher up TI's if you can" i love this thing: Im a P2  TI-30X IIS: My son started using this calculator in 6th grade and finds it a great tool to use for his homework. Works good: Good basic scientific calculator. Works good. Does its job. No FX button for those of you that need a calculator with out one. This is perfect and cheap. Engineering: Through experience this is the preferred calculator for our Engineering department in the construction industry. It completes all the necessary function and is a great value for the price. Does what it's supposed to. Nothing more.: This calculator is a very basic scientific calculator. I recommend getting it if your school has a rule against graphing calculators and/or you are a cheap person who doesn't want to buy TI82 " Worn White Edges: My only complaint is that the factory edges of this wallpaper are white. Which means no matter what you do, seems are going to show. Not sure whether I just got a bad roll or what, but I'm a little disappointed. It's hard enough getting seems nice when the paper is good, but when the factory edges are bad, you don't stand a chance. Probably should have returned it, but i didn't know the paper was at fault until a pro looked at it.

I purchased the product from my vet and made certain that it had not been expired. I have kept the six-pack under the recommended storage conditions and have applied it correctly to two cats twice. The cats did not have many fleas to begin with.

After research(online, calling local vets, and visiting stores) I found that Amazon.com has the best price for it."" Product Not as Advertised, but works anyway: The product that was delivered was not the product in the picture. I was trying to purchase the discontinued deodorant that was shown in the picture, but instead I was sent the newer deodorant that I could have easily, and for less money, purchased at a local store. Too expensive shipping costs to send back. Very dissapointed.

Don't be confused by the packaging that looks so much like Bayer Advantage II. I was confused and wasted my money on this. Yes, it did our cat a little bit of good, but Advantage II is so much better.Bayer Advantage II Purple 6-Month Flea Control for Cats 9+ lbs."" NOT Vet Recommended: After taking my cat to the vet to have her spayed, the vet mentioned that she had fleas. I had been noticing small black dots on my cat's fur that according to the vet were ""flea droppings"" from her flea infestation. I had also been noticing some itching, but only after she had visits with dogs, so I assumed the Frontline was killing the fleas on contact...I assumed wrong!The vet said that she had witnessed several cases where Frontline was no longer working and that she recommended Advantage. I have since ordered it and am awaiting its arrival." Terrible: Product did not work at all-I don't know if it was expired or what but I am going to try to get my money back-my animals had more fleas after I put this on than before. I've used Frontline before and have never had this problem" expired goods do not work as well: Although the package was new in box, date manufactured on the back says ""2004"". Can find no expiration date on pkg but lot # is E41907AW >> I take that to mean expiration date was 4-19-07, nearly 4 years old! No wonder this stuff didn't work! So be very careful when ordering flea meds from Amazon."" Flea population %95 gone: This product has done what it said. The fleas that bite the cats almost all die within a few hours and those that live to lay, their eggs seem mostly infertile.

Yes even the ones in my carpet are gone. And my cats are so happy now."" frontline flea and tick medicine: this is the best product to get rid of fleas, our new cat was infested and this did the job i wont use anything else"" Invest in the competition instead: Advantage (Bayer) is MUCH better that Frontline. Frontline worked for the first week, then the fleas came back. By week three my cats were infested, with one week to go for their next treatments. Horrible product. Advantage (the one made by Bayer), has cleared up 98% of the fleas my cats had in just two months, where Frontline couldn't keep them flea free in the 6 months I used the product." How to use frontline for cats: Take $70 out of your wallet. Light it on fire. Go buy advantage. Frontline is utterly worthless. I have a 20lb indoor cat who has been plagued by fleas this winter. I won't go into the ordeal I have gone through for the past 3 months. But in short- I followed their directions in case of re-infestation and ended up using 6 month supply in half the time. Not only did this cheat me out of a refund but made my poor cat suffer. I would give it a Zero if I could." Product is exactly as ordered: I received the exact item that is displayed in the picture. All if the correct warnings and labels as well. Frontline and Advantage are the only two products I have yet to try for my cat's fleas. I will change the rating if and/when I see the results. I'm starting at 4 stars because I was worried that I would receive a product unlike what is shown/ordered. (As others have stated) I will update the review on the results soon.Update: After over 24 hours, the cats have stopped scratching. So far so good!"" Worst Batch of Frontline Plus: I have purchased Frontline Plus for my cats for the past two years. Usually I purchase through PetcareRx, but Amazon's price was better. When I got, some of the little vials were not filled the same, some had less than the others. No big deal, then I opened the stuff and it smelt like a skunk. I didn't remember the others smelling this way, so I went to Petco in my town and bought another package, sure enough it didn't smell. I tossed the whole thing and am going back to PetcareRx to purchase again, no matter what the price."" reasonable/not working: not happy,use all the time and this year its not working so good,hanged to another brand.good price but not happy with product nymore"" Best stuff !!!!: I switched to a ""natural"" remedy recently because I was concerned about the chemicals on my pets but then was literally hit with tons of super fleas. I don't get how it got to out of hand so quickly but let me say that after all the money I have wasted on the natural baths, sprays and powders that don't work, I am horrified how one of my pets have bitten off large spots of hair and very quickly. I felt so bad. I bought them this frontline plus for the dogs and cat and within two days I saw great results. Before I tried frontline we tried the OTC brands at the pet store and they didn't work on the dogs at all and they made the cat very sick. This was recommended by friends, family and the vet. Worth every penny and Amazon is the cheapest I have found for the Frontline products and I have searched all over the web. $22.50 for a product that compares everywhere else for $40-$50 and free shipping too. Love it." DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE - NO STARS: Been using FL for yrs and have had no trouble w/fleas. The last two applications have not worked. I even wondered if they were just filling those little vials w/water. Something is wrong and I definitely want my money back." Does not work: FrontLine Plus for cats did not work for my cat. On the advice of the sales lady at a veterinary dispensary, I bought this product instead of Advantage, the product my vet normally prescribes for my cat (and which actually works!). I must say I am terribly disappointed. I applied the dosage exactly as directed in the instructions. It has been a week and my cat is still scratching like crazy from fleas. Fortunately, I only bought a single pack and not the whole box. My advice to anyone considering this product is to save your money and buy something else! Based on my experience, I would not recommend Frontline Plus to anyone." Not happy: Not satisfied with this product. The cats have fleas and ticks after applying Frontline Plus. It does not work for 30 days as advertised." A lot better than the alternative!: To be honest about it, our cat hates our applying it to the back of his neck. And he will continue scratching even after it is applied. But there won't be any NEW bites, so the scratching eventually abates. I just wish the treatment wasn't so tough on our cat and that it would be effective longer than 3-4 weeks. That's simply too often (probably unhealthy) to apply treatments, so we wait until 5-6 weeks."" Use to work: I use to swear by Frontline... but have been dealing with a nasty flea infestation and am going to switch to Advantage. My cat is an indoor cat, he has been on Frontline for four months, and we have been finding 10 plus fleas on him a day this last month. Yesterday we found 35, and today 48. Does not sound like flea control to me. I cannot even find an email to send them a letter about my frustration."" God Sent: If you've ever been bitten by a tick or fleas, then you'll completely understand the need for treatment & prevention of such pests. If your serious about that notion then you will want Frontline Plus. It Works. Guaranteed. Frontline Plus, for people who seriously don't want to deal with fleas....and also for people who actually care about their cat's health & well-being. seriously, if you don't buy this, you don't love your cat. Vote Bob Dole" Formula sold by seller is diluted or fake; product not effective: I've bought Frontline on Amazon for years. This is the first time where it absolutely wasn't effective.First applied July 15th; reapplied after the 1st of August because I still found fleas. It is August 8th and my cat still has lots of fleas.Go to your vet or a reputable source for the real Frontline; avoid wasting money on this seller." NOT THE BEST!: Unfortunately Soldiers of Ice was a quite a disappointment! The title is a bit misleading if you are expecting epic battles/wars. There are encounters with ice mephits and elementals (one of each...) and gnolls, but the book lacks that extra something needed to push it over the top. Both the plot and the writing are average. Instead, I recommend other books from the Series such as Red Magic or Parched Sea to mention a few, all the while keeping in mind the ""heavy artillery"" Forgotten Realms novels that have been written by RA Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Ed Greenwood etc My advice, read the Soldiers of Ice only after you're done reading most of the other Forgotten Realms books and you are still in need of more Toril related material."" Good Value: Had been looking for a Bunco set for quite some time. So glad I found this one. We have had hours of fun with it already. The box comes with everything you need to play right away. Lots of score pads and pencils. My only concern with the product was the ""string"" handle that was included in the box. No one was sure how to connect it but eventually we figured it out. This is a great value and loads of fun." Run Do Not Walk When Mandy is On: There are not too many recording artists that I find so versatile. I literally ran home the other night to watch an episode of Chicago Hope just because Mandy Patinkin was guest starring in the episode and to be able to both hear him sing and watch him actor is a wonderful combination. I am very sorry that I had to miss his performance the last time he was in the Philadelphia area." An example for every Field Guide: This work is all a bird watcher could wish for. The splendid paintings by Tudor add to the very helpful in-depth descriptions. Completed by nearly 1500 distribution maps there's nothing left to wish, except go out there and see them. I used it when birding in Peru and I could still determine nearly all the birds I saw.It's an example for every bird field guide."" 4 and a half stars: I think 4 and half would be accurate.What you need to know is that all the companies put out their own comparisons - it is annoying. Multipure claims that Aquasana does not filter out a bunch of stuff - that seems to be reported incorrectly. I give minor props to Aquasana for not attacking the competitor.The real skinny is that Aquasana had problemw with their casing and the faucet leaking over time. Both seem to be resolved. Over time (I have used AQ for about 5 years) whenever I had a problem I called support and they sent me a replacement immediately at no charge with no hassle. Even when they changed the faucet type for the undersink style, they sent me all the new stuff no charge. As much as a hassle as it was to replace the stuff it wss done immediately no questions.PS the water tastes great."" Awful quality! Do NOT buy!: I had this system professionally installed, with the instructions followed to the letter... it lasted about two weeks. Whatever position the knob is in, water flows continuously, and the system had to be turned off at the water valve under the sink. I should have researched more, because this problem seems to be common."" Weird, But Interesting: I've had this book for a long time--over 15 years. I never much liked it, although it does have some interesting spreads that beginners might like to add to their repertoire. The interpretations of the cards, though, are wildly different from anything you are likely to find in any other mainstream tarot text. Perhaps I'd have a more generous appreciation for this book if I had the deck that the authors refer to, but as a book for users of more standard decks, this book's interpretations are close to useless."" Interminable and Pointless: ""Lincoln"" was interminable and pointless, and I only finished it because I already had invested so much time in it. I think it blighted an entire June. I know all the history that people are praising Vidal for covering, but in my opinion nothing in this book makes that history come alive. If you want Civil War history read Gary Gallagher or one of the other talented contemporary Civil War historians."" Stephen Chow's Best - don't forget the sequel, or the book!: This was one of the first DVDs I bought for my collection after getting a DVD player. The plot is engaging and extermely well-written, and the brilliant physical comic performances of Stephen Chow and Ng Man Tat work wonderfully even for someone like myself who needs the subtitles to follow the story.Be aware, though, that ""Royal Tramp"" and ""Royal Tramp 2"" are a single story split into two parts, rather than just a movie and its sequel. Be sure to get both.Also, this movie is based in the only story by Louis Cha that is currently available in translation. The title of the book is usually translated as ""The Duke of Deer Mountain"", but the English translation (in 3 volumes) is called ""The Deer and the Cauldron"", Volumes 1 " Buy Region 2: This is perhaps one of the worst DVD transfers around. Not only is the print bad but the entire film is out of focus. The region 2 " Don' Bother Unless...It's Moroder (out of print): No copy of Metropolis is of any worth unless it's the version that was done by Giorgio Moroder. As far as I know none exist except for some old VHS copies (expensive- I own one.) It's a shame since the Moroder film combined modern rock with the best revitalized long version copy of Metropolis one could get and infused hard to find stills into it that are representative of missing pieces of the film. Pieces that are gone forever, but the stills at least tend to make the story much clearer. When are the people who have the means going to put the Moroder version on DVD? Like NEVER?"" POOR PRINT: The visual quality of this print is poor; also, the opening credits are out of focus and the opening intertitles are severely truncated."" Stupefying!!: I've been waiting for this DVD for decades.It's my absolute favorite version of Metropolis.Moroder did a fantastic job with the color tinting and music.I think even Fritz Lang would approve.If someone who was not aware of this great film saw only the Moroder version,they would think it is the coolest,hippest film ever!Now if they would come out with Cobra Woman and other Maria Montez movies....."" An Opinion Contrary to Convention: I kept waiting for the great looking female robot (what really qualifies this as sci-fi), and she has all of a minute of screen time! All that work to design and create her, so why not find a way to use her? As to the poignancy of the narrative, it is basically angry communist propaganda. Time did not prove that philosophy relevant. There is nothing particularly groundbreaking about the story, the cinematography, nor the acting. And the entertainment value is fairly low for a film this deep into the silent era. I really don't think this film is at all entertaining or important. Fire away, but I think this is probably the overrated silent film ever."" Impossible to view: Sadly it was not possible to view this classical masterpiece because the dvd had the wrong regioncode ( NTSC in case of PAL, necessary for Europe). Nor Amazon neither me could know this because the box didn't mention the regioncode but the disc did not mention it either. So I could not enjoy it. I cannot return the dvd because I needed to play it to find out the regioncode problem. Something to know when you're living in Europe and want to view Metropolis." Great!: Its a great movie and I liked the extended version gives it a different feeling for those who have seen the shorter one. Still amazing though. DEFECTIVE DVD! NO Bonus Features!!: NONE of the Bonus Features on this Disc work even though it was shrink wrapped new when I purchased it. The disc looks pristine so there must be a problem in the manufacturing of it. Is there a mass recall on this disc? Someone tell me what's going on? I called the company but there was no one there to answer my call." I'm still waiting to see a good print of this movie!: When I saw this DVD at a bargain price, I said ""Wow, I've got to get this deal."" I was ... It's not much money, but I could have spent it on a couple of six-packs. I thought DVD was supposed to mean outstanding quality. I've seen 16mm films on Fatty Arbuckle from 1920 that look better than this. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. The ""soundtrack"" sounds like a bad funeral ... I've never seen this movie all the way through because every print I've ever seen loses my interest after 15 minutes or so. Maybe it's just way past its prime. Maybe it's just a relic.I'm confused. Well, at least I've got a new coaster for the beer."" Great Movie--Painfully bad transfer.: Metropolis is one of the greatest movies of all time. Visually, it is still ripped off almost on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this DVD version is agonizing to watch. I lasted about 20 seconds and the disc was stored away. Hopefully someone will release a copy with both ""traditional"" and Georgio Moroder soundtracks. A perfect opportunity to utilize the capabilities of DVD"" Oh, please!: The other reviewers are correct about this, the movie is good, but the Madacy DVD sold here for under $10 is terrible. You can tell it's been transferred from video, because there is a horizontal dropout-discoloration in the first 10 minutes! It's a shame there are no good versions out, as far as I can tell, and although I haven't seen the ""rock n' roll"" version, I would want an edition with original musical score (if possible). Don't buy this disc. Maybe there exists a better VHS version, but the one sold here is apparently pretty bad also."" such poor physicality: I regret two things: 1- prior to my purchase not reading other user reviews which stated about the poor recording quality of the DVD, 2- rating such a masterpiece 2 "" Outdated and incorrect: I began using this book to prep for my trust and estates final exam, but I immediately found some obvious errors. I'm not sure if the errors are a result of it being outdated or the author incorrectly reading the UPC and state statutes. Regardless I found several errors in the first section alone and immediately stopped using it."" Such a terrible Single from a terrible Album!: I cant see how this pathetic horrid single from Ex Westlifer Brian McFadden is wonderfull, its totally terrible, depressive and with such pathetic lyrics ""Real to me"" that anyone on the street could have written, shocking. I'm real lost for words, totally lsot for words how bad this single is. The other songs on it are also so terrible. I think only Westlife Fans may like it, but for all others please skipp this - There are far better singles than this one from this terrible Singer Brian McFadden." Bachelorette karoke: I was a little dissappointed with this DVD. I felt it was a liitle fast with no pause in between." Men in Black 3(2012): Men in Black 3(2012) is a good sequel. Agent J(Will Smith) travels back to the year 1969 to stop Boris The Animal from killing Agent K(Tommy Lee Jones). Josh Brolin played a young Agent K for most of the film. The scenes in 1969 feel like a Mad Men episode. There are some plot holes and the theme song by Pitbull is a little bland. The Men in Black movies have a lighter tone than the Men in Black comic books created by Lowell Cunningham. In the comic books, the Men in Black killed innocent people, fought werewolves, and Agent J was a white, Caucasian man! Men in Black 3 is worth watching with some popcorn, candy, and soft drinks."" Pretty lame: Wow - this was a real disappointment. All gee-whiz special effects, crude violence and rapid-fire but curiously lifeless dialog, lots of uninvolving would-be crisp banter. This film had no emotional core, no compelling plot and nothing really mind-blowing or even mildly thought-provoking, at least nothing to compare to the freshness of the first two MIB flicks. I suspect many scenes looked awesome in 3D -- I saw it on a regular old DVD and thought it was pretty lame. (Axton)"" MIB III: Once again I received a movie from Amazon with the 100% USELESS ultraviolet download. Hopefully one of these days, I will get sick enough of getting this garbage and just stop buying movies." Pretty bad.: NOBODY liked it ! Bring back ALL the regular cast! EVERYONES' acting was TERRIBLE and YUK! Waste of anyones' money! It takes forever to download to my TiVo!!!: I went ahead and got it at Red Box - after waiting for 2  Good Movie: Worthy of the MIB name a good follow up that pieces the trilogy together. Well worth renting especially if your a fan of the movies." Boring.....: Repetitive, if you've seen the first two, you've seen this one. Slight changes but mostly the same old shtick from the last two"" A poor sequel: This is really a clunky film. The only mildly amusing part of it is Brolin's spot-on impression of Tommy Lee Jones. Otherwise, give it a pass."" Time to dump Will Smith and reboot: This movie wasn't terrible, but Will Smith is sleepwalking through his roles now and just looks old. There was nothing special about this film at all. Smith looked bored and overpaid. The direction and editing was subpar and rushed. It's a terrible shame, but this could be a great franchise with different actors who care, and an exceptional director. What was promising in the first one, has yielded mediocrity in the sequels. Smith has to be to blame. It's such a shame, he was a very good actor in the 90's." All MIB movies: I like all the MIB movies. Thats all i'm going to say about the movies. I'm not going to rant or rave about it" mib 3: well mib 3 was and is a hit tommy lee ,will smith and crew did a great job on mib3 ive watch all 3 3 times now :)"" ""ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!"": When I viewed MIB, I thought it was very funny and highly entertaining. When I viewed MIB2, I felt as if something was missing and did not find it as enjoyable as MIB. I found MIB3 to be the Best of the 3 films, the most entertaining and the most enjoyable science fiction movie I've seen in a long time. The aliens are fascinating, and many credits go to creativity. The time jump will grab your interest as we wonder which future will occur? The acting performance of Brolin and Michael Stuhlburg is superb, they are indeed mesmerizing! The impression of Tommy Lee Jones is incredible and the creatures are visually appealing. Overall, the perfect movie to see with a huge bag of buttered-popcorn!" boring: Typical boring Hollywood shoot 'em up. One dimensional characters with big guns. Each scene is a repeat of the previous. Not As Good as 1 " good: A good movie. Kept my interest. Cute aliens & ugly aliens. the story played out like normal. good guy versus bad guy, but with enough side story to keep me interested."" Better than I though: I really enjoyed this movie. It was well written, humorous, and the action was above par. It's not a 'Keeper' like the first but well worth 2 " Really fun and really funny!: My only complaint is that the picture quality felt like I was watching it on VHS. Other than that... What a surprise! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have not missed a beat. And Josh Brolin may actually do a better job of playing Tommy Lee Jones that Mr. Jones does himself! Jemaine Clement is excellent as Boris and Emma Thompson plays straight and silly to a T. Great turn by Bill Hader too as a surprise MIB agent. The special effects and make up effects have not lost a beat either. Amazing that it's been 14 years since the original!Highly recommended! not the best mib: I have watched every MIB movie. This was a disappointment with the special effects. Not as many aliens as in the others. Its not a complete disappointment... But I would just rent this and not make the mistake I did with a purchase of the cd." MIB 3 was the best yet: This one is worth owning! The best M.I.B. yet! The ending is unbelievable, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith did it again!"" Auntie Mame is delightful!: Auntie Mame DVD:I know it's from 1957 but I love seeing how people were distinctly separated into classes with their prejudices and how one crazy woman tries to raise a boy to not fall into those trappings and to not be a snob. Touching, heart-warming; I laugh, I cry. I watch it every holiday season. This DVD will replace my VHS format."" Was Disappointed: I chose to rent before buying; and am I ever glad that I did. I loved MIB; not MIBII, and for me the only saving grace for the third installment was Josh Brolin. No one else could have portrayed a young Tommy Lee Jones with what appeared to be such ease.The story line could have been stronger; and I have to ask why did they cast Emma Thompson?As others have stated, Will Smith certainly could have used more sass; and it seemed to me that even the aliens were old and tired, I can't imagine that these men needed the salaries they were paid; so why did they not insist upon a better production.I may watch it again, as they offer 48 hour rental, but as it stands now I'd have to say, watch the trailer; it containes the best scenes and most laughs." MBIII more of the same: Some of the effects in this movie seem like rehashes of the first two however it did have flashes of entertaining moments. This movie did have an insightful ending. The ending does have a sense of closure about it. Hopefully the producers leave it at that and do not turn this into a Rambo or Rocky type of scenario. Three of these is enough. stupid: This was a dumb movie. I did not like it at all. I did not even finish watching it. It was a waste of time. Awesome Movie!: This one is just as cool as the other two movies. It's a great movie to watch on a Friday night. Very nice value: I am very pleased with this product. I like having the two alarms and that both of the alarms are fairly quiet at first. I hate alarms that scare the crackers out of you first thing in the morning! I also like the fact that the display brightness can be adjusted...." Distinct pros and cons: Pros: dual alarm either music or buzzerNice nap featureEasy to setAdjustable brightness of digital displayNice sound when it's coming through clearCons: If you choose the buzzer wakeup option, it's too loudThe knobs to adjust volume, lowest level is too loudIt's not easy to get a clear channel and once you do, it doesn't stay that way.This alarm clock has potential with a few tweaks by the manufacturer.It's probably worth $10."" Big buttons and display: Another reviewer said this clock looks much better than in the picture - I totally agree with that. I was very pleasantly surprised, especially that the top buttons are metal, not plastic as they look in the picture.In addition to agreeing with other reviewers comments, I wanted to add that the buttons on the top, including the sliding button in center where you set your clock time and alarm times, are all good sized! It's wonderful because it makes it so easy to use. I even ordered a second one for my Mom - the display is large enough to see without glasses and the chunky buttons make it easy for stiff hands to set the time/alarms without fumbling and fuming.I'd rate this as a great find for the price if you're looking for an easy-to-use, easy-to-see basic radio alarm clock."" Definitely Avoid This Clock: I've had this alarm clock for less than 3 months. I absolutely loved this alarm clock until today. I came home and discovered it had froze up with some cryptic symbols that don't even resemble the time. You can push every button and nothing happens, even unplugging it does nothing. I have never heard of a clock freezing up before. But after a little research, it seems a lot of different models of RCA alarm clocks are freezing up like this. This will be the last RCA product I will ever purchase, as I had problems with their other products too."" Windows needed for the CD!: The book looks very good - coverage seems to be in the right depth. There are however lots of typographical errors and it seems odd to me that a certification book on Linux has a CD-ROM that needs to be installed in Windows to get access to all of the software!! In the words of the book ""A limited version of CertTrainer for Linux is included on the CD"". When you are learning Linux, you need Linux going."" Excellent overview: I haven't found a better quick overview of sub-Sahara Africa. Necessarily simplified and reflecting an Economist magazine-type conservatism, Guest nonetheless provide a lot of information."" Excellent addition to worn mattress!: We bought this mattress topper because our mattress is at the end of its life and we would like to wait another year or so to buy a bed. I have slept so well since putting the pad on the bed! No more pressure points.My husband tends to run warm and has no complaints regarding increased temperature with the mattress pad. I highly recommend this mattress pad.I opened the package in a spare room and let the pad sit for six hours. It was fully up to size within an hour. It did off gas for about two days and then no more smell. It is heavy for its size, but fits the bed perfectly."" amazing comfort for the price: I ordered a twin and mailed to family I was going to visit whose beds are too hard for me, my sister was coming and she has Rheumatoid Arthritis and needs a foam type topper to reduce pressure points both of slept on it and what a difference!Took a fairly miserable hard twin bed experience and made it actually comfortable. Its so good Im going to order one or more for home.I just got this a month or so i dont know how the wear and durability will be (they all seem to degrade over time), but so far I am very very impressed!" AMAZING: I am so in love with this memory foam! I have had it for months now and love it every time that I lie down. It is so comfortable! I have had other brands in the past and this one is by far the best. It is squishy but still has a firm feel to it and I sink right in. Highly recommend it. Bait and switch: Read the over reviews - the company isn't selling the same product anymore. The new product is not even memory foam. Shady!" Hot and Soft: This did provide some softness to a firm mattress. However, after sleeping on the pad for a while it trapped the heat and became very hot to sleep on. Once it heats up it also loses a lot of its firmness and smushes right down. I would opt for a pad with a higher density than this pad offers." beware : very strong smell: I am going to try to pack these up. The smell is very strong. I am worried the chemicals on it are toxic. They are in an upstairs bedroom but I can smell them downstairs and totally in the other side of the house. I can not even believe how strong the smell is. I actually felt a burning in my nose when near them. They have been unwrapped for several hours and the smell has not lessened." Excellent addition to a bed: I purchased this mattress topper based on previous reviews and anticipated its arrival. I have been sleeping on this topper for approximately two weeks and have an amazing nights sleep each and every night. I find that I am not tossing and turning nearly as much, which makes my bed extremely easy to make each morning. The initial smell was interesting and reminded me of candy canes. The smell is my only complaint, like previous posts, but it eventually wears off. This was well worth every penny and appears to be of better quality than ones I have seen for much more in department stores."" Disappointed: I thought all Full beds were standard, but this came in a box marked Full and fit more like a twin... I don't know if there was a mistake, but we were not happy with the fit. Waste of money, can't use it."" So Comfy!!: Unfortunately when we bought our kids bunkbeds and mattresses 7 years ago, we didn't have very much money. The springs in the mattresses are now just incredibly uncomfortable. I ordered two of these a few weeks ago and am so happy with my decision. My kids beds are now more comfortable than mine. Well worth the cost!!!"" Very comfortable~: This mattress pad was well reviewed, and it is as comfortable as described. We are overseas sleeping on board-like beds and the twin and queen-sized mattress toppers have made us feel at home again. Thanks for a great product!" Yea baby!....sleeping like a baby.: First of all thanks to all who added posts. I based my decision on your opinions and am very pleased. I received a few days after ordering. Pad did not have any odor but I let it breathe for a day. Fits bed perfectly along with my mattress pad & sheets. 2 " Very firm, OK for the price: I did a lot of research and after reading one amazing review after another, I decided to go for it. I've slept on this for over two weeks and can honestly say that I am not fully satisfied. As with almost anything dealing with bedding, this had a factory smell (mint chocolate chip...no kidding). The smell is decimating slowly but surely. I find the mattress to be very firm for ""memory foam"". I expected to almost nest into the topper but it doesn't exactly work like that. I still toss and turn and and notice no difference since I've put this on. I need something softer. I would not recommend it."" It IS too hot: It is TOO HOT. I like a cool room and warm bedding, but this is more than I can stand.The website says, ""Contrasted with many memory foams which seem to trap heat, ViscO2 "" comfortable: I am very happy with this memory topper. The bed is much more comfortable, and I sleep much better:)"" The perfect addition to any uncomfortable bed: This foam bed topper is perfect for anyone who's been kept up by an uncomfortable bed; it's super dense, and thick enough that anyone will be comfortable with it. The density is important, because the denser a foam topper is, the more able it is to hold up weight without losing the plushness you for which you bought it. After having this one a year, it's still going strong--no dents from where it's been slept on, either.The ventilation holes are ripping a bit in some places, but if I had the choice to purchase it again, I'd buy it in a heartbeat."" Great memory foam!: I bought this to fix the sagging mattress on my twin bed (which I've had for at least 25 years!) at my parents' house. For twenty-five bucks, the topper was a cheap and cost effective way to make my twin mattress super comfy. I spent like 15 hours a day in bed, sleeping and reading because it was just that comfy. It compares well to the queen sized all-memory foam (ok, 6 in of 4lb memory foam, and 8 in of traditional high density foam) mattress that I have in my own apartment.It doesn't have a cover on the memory foam, but I put it inside the allergy cover that was already on top of the bed. A mattress pad is unnecessary and might interfere with the heat-sensitive properties of the memory foam.The only drawback: When it's really really cold (like 50 and below), the memory foam is a bit stiff until you warm it up with your body heat."" Comfortable, good value for the $$: If your bed is in good condition and you want to make it softer and a bit more comfortable, this is a nice item. Compared to other toppers, while not the cheapest, it is relatively inexpensive and provides a good value."" Comfortable with good price: We are pleased with this mattress topper. I don't know if I'd call it memory foam though. When you first take it out of the package you will notice a distinct chemical smell, which disappears in approximately 2 "" Very satisfied after one year: We've used two of these for a year. One is on a queen bed, another on a double bed. Each bed has a mattress that is extremely, uncomfortably firm. This topper has transformed each mattress into a remarkably comfortable sleeping surface. After one year, the foam is like new. No discoloration, no odor, no loss of density or recovery.We also have a king bed with a Cuddledown down-filled topper. It was purchased years ago for many times the price of these foam toppers. We will probably replace the down topper with the foam - they are more comfortable than the down."" No memory: Product title is misleading. This should not be called a memory foam topper. It is just foam. If you push down on it with your hand, it doesn't leave any imprint. Not even for a split second. I wish I had spent more for real memory foam." Smell is Overpowering: I've been shopping on amazon for 7 years and this is the first time I've ever written a review. I've used memory foam in the past and have loved them and never had any issues with the smell. When I received the package and opened the box I noticed that it smelled like chocolate mint. At first I thought it wouldn't be too bad but when I put the topper on my bed it became obnoxiously terrible. While the topper was very comfortable I could not get over this smell. I finally had to take the topper off because every time I walked into my room it smelled like moldy chocolate mint. To make matters worse the smell stuck to my brand new Sealy mattress after I took the topper off. Just returned this product. The only reason I gave it a second star was because it was comfortable. Just couldn't get over the smell.Update 10/2Bed still smells like moldy chocolate mint even after the topper has been off for a week. Problems with the first product: Bought this target a year ago. It worked fine for a couple of months. Adjusting screws loosens up after shooting a couple hundred rounds of .22  dont use a .22  wrong battery for the Panasonic KX-TG1000N: In March 2002 " Gary Hoyt: Stanley makes fine products and always stands behind what they sell. Thats why I buy Stanley.Ok, this lockset is good quality. The ""lifespan"" of the brass finish warranting it for lifetime has had to be called three times in the past 6 yrs. The brass on the outside knob goes bad. Other than that its a good lockset. The brass finish on the replacements has come out of China and Mexico."" Maybe the best I've found: This may be the best Oracle book I've found so far.A lot of books seem to give canned explanations of how oracle works - geared towards rote memorization as opposed to understanding. This book does a great job of taking the next step.For example, The detail with which the author goes through the process of how updating a row actually works in an Oracle database was tremendous. His explanation of how a select statement could actually cause a row to be marked as committed ( i.e. a read causes a write ) was great.I've only been a DBA (or pseudo-DBA) for about 6 months now, so I'm certainly no expert in this area. Yet I found all of his explanations very clear and easy to understand.If you're looking for a new Oracle book, get this one."" Horrible!: I purchased this product and wish I had paid attention to the one negative review it received. This wedge comes in two pieces and it does have a zipper down the middle. The zipper, although on the back, still pokes out and can harm a child. This is so poorly made I am shocked they try to sell it! Moms out there, please beware when purchasing this exact product!"" Great Until Baby Starts Moving: I really like the Safe Lift Deluxe. I bought it for both of my daughters. It is great at helping to reduce reflux because it keeps them elevated...that is until they start to move a lot. Once they start wiggling around, they slide down the lift in a matter of minutes. However, I still use them. My 2 "" Two piece foam with gap in the middle. NO GOOD: I should have read the reviews first. Like everyone said, this is a two piece foams, uneven in height, leaving a gap in the middle where the baby head lies. It's cheap, but save your $12 "" Excellent shaver for the money: Bought this one as a backup, I've been using this model for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied with its performance."" Panasonic wet/dry shaver: Have enjoyed using this shaver and would do it all over again. Very satisfied, and comes completely as advertised. Wish I would have gotten it sooner."" Not up to the hype: I got this as a gold box deal and for $20, it is ok. It does my cheeks fine. It doesn't do my neck at all and only does the chin mediocre. I mostly use it dry and had an even more difficult time using it wet. I've had to redo my neck with my Mach 3 frequently. It's good on light, non-course hair that isn't too long." Worst Shaver Ever!: I bought this Panasonic shaver based on the reviews on Amazon and was greatly disappointed.I tried it as a standard dry shaver and it kept missing hairs. I tried it as a wet shaver and I tried it with shaving cream but still got poor results. I ending up buying another shaver 2 " You get what you pay for - lousy shaver: I have used this shaver for several months - and it is a hassle to shave, it misses hairs and takes forever. Not recommended." good when used frequently: Since there are only 2 " worst shave ever: I have a light beard. This is without question the worst shaver I have ever used. The only use I would recommend it for, is as a play toy shaver for your 5 year old son - it has a neat yellow racing track on the shaver molding which looks nice and the shaver makes a buzzing sound and a little boy would like that- he could believe he was shaving just like Dad.I can't believe that Panasonic would put their brand name on this piece of junk.[...]If there was a zero star ranking, it would get ZERO. It is not worth a single star.Now you know." Passable Electric Razor: This razor is ok for a 1  All right as a standby: It's light and inexpensive. Not too good doing your beard. Good as a spare or for travel but I'm not sure if it can be charged on 220-volt outlet. It is not marked on the charging base." Miracle Stick for Baby Cheeks: I have used this stick from day 3 of my baby's life and I absolutely love it. It is a must for anyone who lives in a remotely dry climate and wants to protect their baby's cheeks. It smells like vanilla - far, far better smelling than any other Mustela product (which I always find way too perfumey). It's kind of like a solid deodorant in texture, you just swipe it across the cheek and it adds instant moisture. Now that my little one is older and more wiggly, I can still get those cheeks moisturized without fighting. Buy this now - you will not regret it!"" Passable, but not memorable: I was so excited while watching a tape of Michelle Kwan skating to ""East of Eden"". I had heard the music for years and could never remember the name. So, when I discovered there was a recording of it, I was enthralled. To my complete disappointment, the CD skips over the most lucid and poignant lines of the melody in favor of a sampling approach. I will probably never listen to the CD again. My only hope is Michelle will keep her program for a while."" Eden's Curve:Romance. Passion. Sensuality. Tragedy and Love.: Anne Misawa's debut as the director of Eden's Curve takes a rare and candid look through the camera's eye into the first foundations of man to man love, loss, tradegy, sex, passion and the trials of same-sex love that face every new generation of those who dare to follow their God-given instincts and defy the oppression of unending misunderstanding from the traditional world.Her camera moves inside the act of love. It makes you nervous and brings on heavy breathing like the act of love itself. See it with someone you can sit close to, someone that holds you tight, or someone you want to have hold you tight. Bring a handkerchief.The acting. The writing. The production is the best of what strapped and free independent movie making is about." safety glasses: these are by far the best safety glasses ever made. the bifocal helps immensely for reading small print while being in a work setting. would recommend these glasses to anyone. thanks TI 92-Plus a must for a university student: I've got the ti92plus exaclly 1 " SLEEPER NO YAWNER: Steven Harriman (aka Steven Spruill) has written a tight, original and suspenseful thriller in SLEEPER. Although there are a couple of lengthy sequences that tend to distract the reader, he provides us with some three-dimensional characters that one can identify and empathize with: Dr. Andrea DeLuca, a brilliant herpetologist, more involved in the creature's background than she can imagine; Ed Jeffers, a conscientious and loyal member of the Pentagon, whose own disability haunts his life; and the macho Terrill Hodge, the SEALS commander with an agenda of his own.Harriman blends these personal crises into the horror of the story very well, and there are several scenes of bloodcurdling terror. This novel isn't as good as Matt Reilly's action books or as exciting as ""Jinn"", but it is a good read and would like to see more of Harriman in the future."" Aztecs and Aliens: Sitchin picks up where he left off, this time adding ancient American mythology and archaeology into his thesis: that Earth was long ago visited by aliens from a tenth planet, that those aliens created Man as we know him, that they are the Gods of olden times. Drawing parallels between the mythologies of the Mayans, Aztecs, Inca, and the peoples of the ancient Middle East, he suggests that the Native Americans were of Cain's line (Tenochitlan = Enochitlan), that the earliest post-diluvial civilizations were established by the same beings that established all other original civilizations, and so on. It's a fun read." Horrible acting: Often graphics and screen shots sell games and the graphics in this are very nice. Unfortunately the voice acting is so horrendously bad that it makes the whole game truly laughable. The main character reads his lines like a DJ reading off the evening news. Some of the ridiculous forced accents are equally terrible. It's like they dug up a few folks from around the neighborhood to do the voices and some have no idea what a German or French accent is supposed to sounds like. I can't get over it...ruins the whole game." Insensitive and offensive: The book is not so much about bread itself but about the author's experiences in various cultures around the world, all connected by the common theme of bread baking. But that is not what bothered me. In fact she is privileged to have many fascinating cultural experiences which could have made for informative and entertaining reading. Unfortunately this was overshadowed for me by her constant stream of critical and demeaning comments about those who were kind enough to be her hosts. She refers more than once to the native food as ""slop"" and at one point suggests that her host is ""in our room sniffing our underwear"" while she and her companion are out exploring. Perhaps such comments are intended to be funny but I found them rude and tasteless. I envied the author's experiences but felt sorry for those who showed kindness to her only to be humiliated by her graceless criticism." The title says it all.: I have used this book for years and order it as gifts for friends. It is so well done and almost every recipe I have tried is not only delicious but simple as well. You just can't beat the simple/delicious factor." CORNETA CON FALLA EN EL AMPLIFICADOR INTERNO: COINCIDO CON UNO DE SUS CLIENTES. VIVO EN VENEZUELA Y CON MUCHO ESFUERZO COMPRE EL EQUIPO.

You'll love this movie too and you'll never guess who the killer is! The second movie is great to, but not as good as the first one. But this doesn't mean you shouldn't see it! Besides, the ending on the First movie will leave wanting to see the sequel right away! So, don't hesitate and as soon as you can afford it, GET IT!!!"" Do not purchase. There are better books: This book is out of date with respect to Securities Operations. Does not covers import topics as Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) or Delivery versus Payment (DvP) in an adequate manner. It felt as though chapter 29 inclusion was the result of trying to address the short comings of the material. This book needs a complete rewrite.A better book would be ""After the Trade is Made"" by David Weiss."" piece of junk: CD player a piece of junk from the beginning--skips in the middle of a track to the next one, doesn't play at all other times. pass it by."" Best gift for handyman: I gave this to my boyfriend, who loved it. As a contractor, he thought it was the best invention ever." Great tool and buy: I purchased 4 of the thumb saver tool sets as Christmas presents. I have used the tool to hold a nail in place in out of the way places where it would be awkward to hold and then strike the nail. The tool works as advertised and the DIY network did a great job making me aware of the tool. I will continue to use the tools and avoid those painful hits to the fingers and thumb. For a home do-it-yourselfer the tool is great." good little helper but too large for attaching picture frame hanger: The magnet is strong and holds any nail larger than 5/8 inches well. However, I bought the tool for nailing jagged frame hangers on the back of picture frames. These come supplied with nails that are roughly a quarter inch long and that is too short for even the smaller magnetic thumbsaver. Going back to comb method. Otherwise a good product." Funny: Once again David E. Talbert never fails to give you a good laugh. This wasn't as funny as baggage claim but it was pretty thought-provoking. The opening and closing arguments the lawyers gave were well written. I liked this book because it kept my attention but the story line wasn't riveting. This was just good entertainment." A Sinking Ship: Absolutely one of the worst--and possibly THE worst--of all the Outer Limits episodes. Usually, the Outer Limits was a brilliant, if sometimes erratic series. Tourist Trap would've been a more apt title for this horrendous episode: after watching it, you'll feel as if you've been an unwilling prisoner for the last hour. ""Horrible"" is too kind a description."" A Lungfish Ate My Homework (Blub!): It could have been worse. It could have lacked the presence of Henry Silva, as a South American despot. Its locales and sets could have been less exotic and lush. Even Janet Blair's legs are surely worth a point or two.Unfortunately, I've named about all this episode is worth. Tourist Attraction has the sad distinction of being the reason many worthier OL entries looked so [bad] - it ate most of the production budget for the first season. And the saddest thing is, you'd never guess it to look at it. The lungfish beasties (they could only afford three, made to look like more through the miracle of recycling) are really unconvincing.Let 'er sail! (Blub, blub, blub...)" As Nasty As They want To Be: This is for the rap fan when you want to listen to something fun. Other rappers and rap groups have tried to copy these type of lyrics but just can't compare. You definitely can't listen to this with your kids around but when you do get a chance to listen you may find yourself laughing out loud like a kid. Highly recommend. Terrible: Brand new item that BUZZES loudly regardless of audio input (or lack of audio). Was forced to return the item immediately." 100% Uacceptable: Save your money.... the unit I got had a distinct hum in it, and the smaller speakers sound tinny and tip over easily. What a lousy design. Unfortunately I'll be stuck with the cost of returning this trash. I use Creative $11 "" sweet mother of god: bought this for my father in law, and i couldn't have wanted to stab myself in the face more if i tried."" AWESOME, EDUCATIVE AND ENTERTAINING, EVEN FOR ADULTS!: This is a rather unusual DVD, it has animal stories in poetry form, and my kids (5 & 6) just love it! For the price, you'll get 4 full hours of joy, with story after story, each one with a special life lesson (fable). You will not regret it!"" One of my all time favorite musicals: Up until now, my favorite musicals have been Chorus Line, Jesus Christ Superstar and Hair. This is the best show I have seen -- hands down.I was lucky enough to see the show twice on Broadway -- both times with John Gallegher, Jr. as Moritz. He was simply fantastic and is on this CD.I really can't speak highly enough about it. My favorite songs: Bitch of Living and I don't Do Sadness/Blue Wind -- with the latter absolutely electrical to see in person with John Gallegher, Jr. and Lauren Pritchard.And, as others have written, I can't stop thinking about it or playing it. Really great!"" Broadway Rock meets Victorian Germany: Following in the footsteps of such Broadway Rock Classics such as Jesus Christ Superstar, & Rent comes Spring Awakenings. Having hear the music on this CD I went to see this incredible coming of age musical in New York. Set in 1890 Germany, Spring Awakenings is based on a play written in this same period. It is remarkable that a 1890 playwrite would have been so ahead of his time to write a story about the supression human sexuality in teens and the harm it can do. The Original Cast recording is one after another passionate, funny and heartfelt songs. There is not one bad track on the album." Spring Awak.: Purchased as a gift. Item arrived on time and in good condition. Gift bearer absolutely loves the soundtrack." a complicated mind: This is a quick little read-just over 40,000 words-about a man and a woman having phone sex. I've always borne the prejudice that nothing could be less interesting than phone sex, particularly somebody else's phone sex. And yet, here we have two people who stray from the topic at hand (so to speak)and from behind the cloak of anonymity, let fly some marvelously revealing fragments of everyday life.Baker has the man say at one point 'an orgasm in a complicated mind is always more interesting than one in a simple mind'. Aside from the acknowledgment that orgasms happen in the mind, this is a wonderful moment. It's one of the many points in this little book when two people take quiet note of each other's humanity. Read this alongside Philip Roth's Deception-a book that's structurally identical and worlds away in spirit.Lynn Hoffman, author of the novel bang BANG"" Love the songs, CD does not work in the car: The music on the CD is beautiful. I love Dawn Upshaw and this CD in particular, but when I received it, I tried to play it in the car right away and it did not work. I thought that it was something with my car stereo system and tried playing it in my stereo at home and that did not work either. The only place that it did work was on my computer so I had to upload the songs to iTunes then burn myself a new CD in order to be able to listen in the car and at work!"" Excellent text, horrible format: This is an excellent textile history survey and a welcome addition to any costume/textile library. However, the changes the publishers have made in producing this edition are deplorable (check the dimensions in the product specs). The book is much smaller than the original edition and difficult to handle when one is reading and taking notes. The font is miniscule, probably about 6 point, and makes reading difficult and unenjoyable. The illustrations - which in the older edition are wonderful - are scaled down to such a small size that their impact and usefulness is diminished considerably. Publishers should keep in mind when they are making changes in format to cut costs that the reader's experience does not suffer." 13 little blue envelopes: I have read several books where someone received envelopes and had to open them at a certain time. I did not like any of them.But this one started out good but only for a couple of chapters. Then every time I picked it up to read it I would fall asleep." Everyone Was Interesting Except the Main Character: This book was disappointing. Never have I encountered a character pushed by plot without experiencing any kind of growth or development. I kept wondering why people were attracted to Ginny because if she had a personality, she sure kept it hidden - the young lady never says more than 2 "" funny: I love Steve Grand's writing voice. He not only writes clearly and in a conversational style, but he makes the information both accessible and entertaining!" Nice Ribbons: These ribbons are nice and are shipped quickly. Sharps Baton is easy to deal with and has great products and communication with customers." drip, drip, drips: after researching different kettles, i decided on this one for features, price and my preference for metal instead of plastic as we are concerned about the safety of plastics . we have always had good experiences with other hamilton beach products. after a month of daily use it now drip, drip, drips from a leak at the base. i will be returning it tomorrow. too bad, as it was a great design-easy to fill, fast heat up. in fact, i may try another one-two times the charm?." Got cut on the metal lip!: Heats fine - but I cut my finger on the very sharp metal on the pouring spout. Not worth it. I've too many other family members who also use it. I was replacing another kettle that I'd had for 4 years which is no longer made. Guess I'll have to keep looking. What I really want is one of the variable temp ones that is also suitable for green teas as well as the higher temps for black teas." Ventana by George Gaytan: Please consider ""Listen to Samples"" offer. Personally, I do not purchase unless I am familiar with (already having heard) or able to listen to samples of music."" Interesting but biased: My current research focuses upon the latter end of the suffrage movement, so I used the last two chapters of this book. Overall, it's detailed and interesting, however, the author's biases against Alice Paul and the NWP is very polemical and uneasy to read.For a more positive look at Alice Paul, I recommend 'From Equal Suffrage to Equal Rights' by Christine Lunardini"" Reality Check: It was nearly impossible for me to put the book down. Reading Barbara LaSalle's story opened up a can of buried emotions. I related so much to Barbara and Ben's journey, all the pain, the tears and yes, the happiness too.The courage they both had to be so candid and honest really reached me and has helped me to better understand myself and my 15 year-old son who also suffers from AS. I've read many ""textbooks"" about AS, but ""Finding Ben"" validated my feelings concerning it.I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle the honest and sometimes cruel reality of living with someone who has a neurological disorder."" Is this for real?: I was ecstatic to find this DVD, because SRatSS has a special place in my heart, a childhood favorite.The picture and sound quality are both great. It's the EPISODES featured that make me see red.Top Ten fan selected episodes... WHO are these fans, and WHAT are they on???????Yes, a few are good. Star Sheriff Roundup, Cavalry Command, and Happy Trails are classic eps, three key points of the SRatSS series.But the other seven episodes? Pure filler, non-relevent. What about the other pivotal episodes? When Commander Eagle is rescued from the Outriders. When Fireball has a near-death crash, loses his memory, and has visions of his heroic father. When Vanquo is well and truly defeated. I'll throw in, just for fun, the cow that attacked Fireball's car when it heard the sound of that horrid horn, and Colt's hilarious teasing afterwards.If you're a true-to-the-heart fan, don't buy this collection. It'll only disappoint you."" Feeling sleepy: If this CD won't put you to sleep nothing will! You don't need Night Quill just pop in this CD. Bowie's 90's music is so far the worst. Then you have just as bad Reality CD the only one worth buying would be Heathen. So almost 20 years from 1990 to 2009 and one decent CD. His true gems are in the 70's. And the 80's had some good stuff, Scary Monsters, Let's Dance and Labyrinth. Oh if buying Bowie's 70's music stay clear of Low and Lodger. They make great dust collectors."" Please!: I happen to be a big fan, but this is some of Bowie's weakest material. Why all the glowing reviews? There are so many other better albums Bowie did. BTWN is a dud!"" Not court cases as I thought: I got this book at the libary and I was so disapointed. From the title I thought it was a book of funny cases. Its not.Its a book on how she became a Judge. there may have been cases ,but I don't remember any."" I loved it. But you shouldn't make me have a headline..you fools!: I thought it was going to be a joke book,but the joke was on me. It was insightful to the workings of the judicial system from one of the most outspoken judges we have. SHe was terrific and I was shocked."" Gipsy Kings, typical Gipsy kings: I find that this album is like ALL the Gipsy Kings albums; very the same material over and over. All Rumbas; over and over. I dont think they reflect true flamenco at all; as they play the same music over and over; do not do soleares; sevillanas etc; if you are a fan of modern jazzy flamenco then you will most likely like this; if you are more of the Carlos Montoya type, forget it and save your money for more authentic music..."" Beautiful Photos but lacks applicability: Lovely photos - so if you want a nice coffee table book, this is a lovely one to have. However, if you want practical information about how to develop and apply this style to your own home, this book doesn't provide basic practical guidelines (granted, I only glanced through it quickly because I found it boring). The author photographed, at the most, 3 separate houses to illustrate the book - way too many white slipcovered down chairs and sofas - and I LOVE white slipcovered down chairs and sofas. I'm looking foward to getting her more recent book ""The Shabby Chic Home"" because I think it will be more practical and applicable to my life. So while I didn't really like this book, I've not given up on this author, nor her unique approach to this style - I think her work is worth another look, but not this book." There are better books out there: I was deeply deeply disappointed with this book. I had come to expect more from the Shabby Chic then I was given this time around. Shabby Chic: These books looked so beautiful in ebook form that I needed to go and purchase the reall thing. Wow they are really worth reading if Shabby Chic is your thing. Beautiful pictures and a good read as well." Typical escapist material, but very beautiful: Contrary to many other viewers' opinions I do not believe in this book's practical worth for those on a tight budget. To me it was immediately obvious that the ""shabby chic"" ought to be understood in the British sense, of making wealth appear casual, spontaneous and a little worn round the edges, , rather than pompous and ostentatious. It is not about making something out of nothing. Trash to treasure guide equally it is not, whatever we may be invited to believe. For the budget conscious it is a stuff to dream around, not to get inspired. But, as escapist stuff it is much superior to many others of its kind, precisely because of this quality of lightheartedness and taking it easy, which are the all important qualities of un-self-conscious decorating." Worst Service Ever: They have not even shipped my book yet and it is past the day that it was said to arrive. Never use this company. They are unpredictable and you will not receive your books on time." What a mess: This review may be a little harsh... but, if you had to sit through an entire semester with this book you would see my point. Book this is full of errors and omissions. Something that can be explained in a few sentences take pages for this author to convey and half the time the reader still has to look elsewhere for clarification of the material. Half way into the semester I had to stop reading the thing and do subject research using other sources. Amazing someone would publish a text book this bad."" Excellent: The Messiah Will Come Again is well worth the price alone. I have been a Gary Moore fan since the late 70's and prefer his pre blues, but this dvd is smoking. His chops, tone, and overall performance is superb. If I thought there was such a thing as 5 stars. I would give this 5. This is a must for all Gary Moore fans. Gary Moore in his prime. Well recorded and shot. This rivals Emerald Isles 1984 and Stockholm 1987. This is a great dvd" sad: did not get- out of stock- gave two stars because seller did tell me what was going on with the order" Great Mini SPDT: Ordered a handful of these mini's to keep around for projects. They fit in small places and none have failed so far. Ordered direct from Amazon with some other stuff, shipping was less this way over ordering direct from supplier." dmv soft lense handler: did not work for me at all. It was too soft to get hold to the lens. i will keep tryng to find the right thing for me. piece of crap: This didn't work for me whatsoever!I tried and tried and tried and all I ended up doing was ripping a new contact and severely irritating my eye." DMV Lens Hander: This product is useless for removing a soft lens. After 3 weeks of trying, I may have been successful twice. Total waste of money. Plus,when I emailed the company for assistance, they never answered."" An eloquent, emotional masterpiece.: To really appreciate this CD, you must see the movie. Each song brings back all the visual and emotional experiences of the film. The soundtrack is haunting, mysterious, and incredibly beautiful. When listening to the music on this CD, you almost want to stop breathing so you don't miss a note. It's all-encompassing. I love it!"" Music does not stand alone: The movie is great and the music fits the movie very well. But without the movie to watch, the music isn't very interesting. The soundtrack has many boring stretches, but if you were watching the movie, the music would make sense.Contrast this soundtrack with that of The Hours, Notes On A Scandal, The Illusionist, Pan's Labyrinth or The Fountain to name just a few. These are great soundtracks either with or without the movie. In other words, the music is independent of the movies.So, you may find my 2-star rewview to be harsh, but as a stand-alone soundtrack, Kundun is well below average."" I love this CD!: This is wonderful mood music. Great for when I'm depressed or just feeling blah. Yano's piano style evokes Sesame Street for me; it's freewheeling and bouncy most of the time, with the just the right mix of pensive and sad stuff thrown in. Makes me feel like an unworried child again. Lyrics mostly in Japanese with a really wonderful set of translations included. Worth reading by themselves without the music. I really dig her vocal style, but it may not be for everyone. My father thinks she sounds like a yowling cat. Try it and decide for yourself."" A documentary for those who wish we still burned people at the stake...: This is not a scientific analysis of the UFO phenomenon, nor is it even an objective commentary on it. If that's what you're in the mood for, skip this. Instead, this is a paranoid fundamentalist Christian take on UFOs, ghosts, and the supernatural in general. Backed up by some photos with dust specks in them and some photoshopped fairy pictures, this film has one angle and one angle only: it's all the work of the devil. Period. Apparently Satan has a UFO factory, and makes flying saucers in his spare time. Who knew?In the end, there's no science here. Only religion pretending to be scientific while attacking scientific study as demonic."" Typical Frank Miller: Nothing particularly new in this installment of the Sin City series, but it's executed in a typical Frank Miller style. While the story seemed to start out a bit slow, it picks up about mid-way through and finishes strong with lots of casual nudity and violence for which Mr. Miller is known. Compared to other books in the series, it's not as powerful of a story as ""That Yellow Bastard"" or ""A Dame to Kill for"" but it's still a solid book (once the story picks up).If you like Sin City, you'll probably like this book. If you're not already a fan, I would recommend you get familiar with one of the more famous installments like those mentioned earlier."" Unbelievably believable characters!: A story full of imagination! Beautiful and complete characters and crazy facts all with a purpose. Monkeys, cats, professors, criminals, magic hands, leadfoots, WINGS and WALLS. The magnificent details and atmosphere of a city like New York in a strange future, makes you feel that the city itself is the protagonist of the story... Comparing this book with Harry Potter on the cover is useless marketing that such a great book does not deserve.(sorry for my english I'm not a native speaker)antonis, author of children's books, greece"
